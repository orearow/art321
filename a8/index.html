  			<h2 class="card-title">Game Play Steps </h2>
 
 1)	I walk around the room going left to right a few times eventually I decide to turn off my alarm and the red flashing light turns off 
2)	I put on my wardrobe and suddenly I am in a suit 
3)	I walk into the kitchen and there is my wife with a pan, I turn the tv off and on a few times 
4)	I walk out the door 
5)	I see a hallway with an elevator, at the end of the hallway I press the button and it turns red 
6)	The elevator opens and I enter it, inside of the elevator is an elevator lady, I talk to her: “five more steps and you will be a new person” what does that mean I wonder? What are the steps? I’ll be  new person how? Is there another level in the game 
7)	At the bottom of the elevator I see that there is another hallway one side of the hall has a blue parking sign while the other is unmarked. I decide to take the left side for some reason, that seems more unusual 
8)	I see a homeless man or a man in a cloak, he seems odd he is just sitting there, not wanting an altercation I go back and take the right side 
9)	I am In a car now! But wait there is traffic. Gross. I get out of my car and walk in the opposite direction of the traffic
10)	I see a cow just grazing in the field, I touch its forehead tenderly in  hiccup/toothless how to train your dragon moment
11)	I keep walking left 
12)	I’m in the same traffic scene so I have no choice but to go back into my car and star driving
13)	I walk past a tree with a leaf, the leaf billows in the wind but it does not fall 
14)	I walk into work, my boss is there and he tells me I am late. I see a downwards trajectory chart in angry red, I walk past it 
15)	I walk past cubicles and cubicles of several me doubles. I see an empty one, my cubicle but I walk past that too. I keep on walking until  I see a sign that leads to the roof. 
16)	I am on top of the roof, there is no railing on it. I see the implication here. Death is an escape – huh kind of dark. I don’t jump. Nah. Does that mean I will lose? I go back to the left, find my cubicle and sit down to do my job 
17)	I wake up again, same scenario, same alarm same clothes. 
18)	I turn my alarm off, I put on my clothes   
19)	I do the same things I did last time but this time
20)	(to be fair in this interaction I try to talk to my wife a bit more before I leave, though it does not work)
21)	I see the elevator lady this time she says 4 steps. I am still confused, what does that mean exactly. I physically take 4 steps. Is that it? No, nothing changes
22)	 I turn left from the elevators to talk to the hooded homeless guy 
23)	“I can take you to a quiet place” he says. What!? That is creepy. Is he going to kill me? No, he takes me to  graveyard…. Ok….. huh. 
24)	I wake up again 
25)	Screw it I am not wearing clothes 
26)	My wife comments about me not wearing clothes – finally something different 
27)	Elevator lady says three more steps…. I think she is just counting down 
28)	I go left again, homeless guy is gone… ok, I go back right 
29)	I drive straight to work, woops forgot about the cow
30)	I see the tree with the leaf, I stand still, the leaf blows away 
31)	I walk to work, lets see what boss man says 
32)	Boss man asks me where my tie is! Like he does not notice I am naked! IM FIRED :O
33)	I’m fired now, do I still have to go to work? I get dressed anyways
34)	I turn the tv off for once 
35)	Elevator lady says two more steps 
36)	I go left, homeless guy is still gone I go right
37)	I get out of my car and go left, cow is gone too
38)	I keep going left, now I am back t my car
39)	I drive again 
40)	I get to the tree and the leaf, this time I catch the leaf and hold it for a bit! 
41)	I walk right! Aren’t I fired? How can I still be going to work 
42)	Again, my boss tells me I am late, he seems to have forgotten I am fired… 
43)	I go to my cubicle and work 
44)	I wake up again… starting to feel the monotony I guess that is the point 
45)	Again I don’t put clothes on, meh 
46)	Elevator lady says one more step… what is the last step 
47)	I go straight to work 
48)	I get fired…. Again 
49)	I wake up, rinse and repeat 
50)	I wake up and I’m still at 1 more step
51)	I go to work, this time I know what I gotta do (the leaf is gone too now)
52)	I go to the end of the building
53)	I jump 
54)	I wake up again! (what!!) 
55)	I put my suit on! 
56)	My wife Is gone the kitchen is empty
57)	Elevator lady is gone! 
58)	Traffic is gone! 
59)	Boss is gone!
60)	What is going on. Am I in the after life? 
61)	Every cubicle worker is gone 
62)	I walk to the roof. And there is me on the railing about to jump
63)	I jump 
64)	The game ends :O 
65)	Dang, that was deep. I think! Interesting game 

            
            
  			<h2 class="card-title">1. How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches? </h2>
There are several way
            
            
            There are several ways that the allowed interaction keeps the narrative on track. 
            In this game the two devices that the game uses are blocks and loops.
            For example, once you finish talking to the homeless man on the right of the parkade there is a stop walk that is always left on red, therefore as a pedestrian you can not pass.
            Because of this you can not pass no matter how long you wait (and I waited a while) your only choice is to continue in the opposite direction and therefore continue in the direction that the narrative want you to take. 
            In the example of loops, when you meet the cow in the field and walk past it, instead of being met with more fields and going off on a brand new adventure instead you redirect back to your car. You can continue this loop as long as you want but eventually the only choice in order to continue the narrative is to drive in your car and head on the path to work.
            Loops again work in the game where you have no choice but to pursue all of the “escapes” the game has for you.
            For example the narrative continues indefinitely until you die.
