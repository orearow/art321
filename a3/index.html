 <p> For this assignment I plan on using the goodreads API in order to create a net art piece related to harry potter. 
 Good reads is a website that lets users rate and review books, and the API for goodreads has a call called
 book.review_counts the importance of this API call is that it would provide me with the data I need to create 
 my piece. By using javascript on the backend to make the API call (using jquery). Part of the information that
 the API provies me is a json dump of book information such as the number of reviews and the number of ratings. 
 
 An example API call for the first Harry Potter Book looks like this: 
 
 <code> {"books":["{"id":1953,"isbn":"0141439602","isbn13":"9780141439600","ratings_count":678172,"reviews_count":1141956,"text_reviews_count":11102,"work_ratings_count":725783,"work_reviews_count":1276333,"work_text_reviews_count":14606,"average_rating":"3.82"}]} </code>
 as you can see we now we know the ratings and reviews for Harry Potter and The Philosoperhs stone. This book has 678172 ratings and 1141956 reviews. 
 
 Now, for the bulk of my project I plan on creating a collage to represent the new ratings and reviews for each of the books in the Harry Potter series. 
 Every time a new rating or review appears I will add an image to the collage. I plan on adding a different image for each book. For example, for Harry
 potter and the Goblet of fire the image added will be a goblet, but for the last Harry potter movie the image added will be the symbol of the 
 deathly hallows. In the end, I hope to create a fun colletion of images representing the readership of this book series. It will look something like this. 
 
 
 Stage 1: The art piece has just begun. We start with a blank canvas because in the first few moments no new ratings and reviews will be added. 
 (We are counting new ratings and reviews instead of the total ratings and reviews because of the sheer magnitude)
