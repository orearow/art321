 <p> For this assignment I plan on using the goodreads API in order to create a net art piece related to harry potter. 
 Good reads is a website that lets users rate and review books, and the API for goodreads has a call called
 book.review_counts the importance of this API call is that it would provide me with the data I need to create 
 my piece. By using javascript on the backend to make the API call (using jquery). Part of the information that
 the API provies me is a json dump of book information such as the number of reviews and the number of ratings. 
 
 An example API call for the first Harry Potter Book looks like this: 
 
 <code> {"books":["{"id":1953,"isbn":"0141439602","isbn13":"9780141439600","ratings_count":678172,"reviews_count":1141956,"text_reviews_count":11102,"work_ratings_count":725783,"work_reviews_count":1276333,"work_text_reviews_count":14606,"average_rating":"3.82"}]} </code>
 as you can see we now we know the ratings and reviews for Harry Potter and The Philosoperhs stone. This book has 678172 ratings and 1141956 reviews. 
 
 Now, for the bulk of my project I plan on creating a collage to represent the new ratings and reviews for each of the books in the Harry Potter series. 
 Every time a new rating or review appears I will add an image to the collage. I plan on adding a different image for each book. For example, for Harry
 potter and the Goblet of fire the image added will be a goblet, but for the last Harry potter movie the image added will be the symbol of the 
 deathly hallows. In the end, I hope to create a fun colletion of images representing the readership of this book series. It will look something like this. 
 
 
 Stage 1: The art piece has just begun. We start with a blank canvas because in the first few moments no new ratings and reviews will be added. 
 (We are counting new ratings and reviews instead of the total ratings and reviews because of the sheer magnitude)

    <p> as mentioned previously I will begin to populate the canvas by making API calls and checking for updates in all of the harry potter book 
      review count numbers! Each book is represented by a symbol. The symbols are as followed. </p>
    
    <h2> Book 1 symbol </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="book1.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
    </div>
      
          <h2> Book 2 symbol </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="book2.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
      
    </div>
      
      
      
      
          <h2> Book 3 symbol </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="book3.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
      
    </div>
      
      
          <h2> Book 4 symbol </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="book4.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
      
    </div>
      
      
          <h2> Book 5 symbol </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="book5.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
      
      
    </div>
      
      
      
          <h2> Book 6 symbol </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="book6.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
      
    </div>
      
      
      
          <h2> Book 7 symbol </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="book7.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
    </div>
      

    <h2> Now for our next steps </h2> 
    <br>
    <p> Now that you know the symbols for each of the books let us pretend that a users have started to change our little piece of net art! 
      lets say that someone is now going on goodreads and rating/reviewing Harry potter books 5, 6 and 3. (Each just once) Now our 
      canvas will look something like this</p>
    
    
    
              <h2>Our canvas now  </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="back30.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
    </div>
      
    
    <br>
    <p> As you can see the expected symbols have started to show up! <p> 
    
    
    
    
    <br>
    
        <h2> let us continue </h2> 
    <br>
    <p> Now let us look at what our net our piece looks like once users slowly started to more harry potter books. Still we are 
    working small scale. We are assuming that only a few more book reviews/rating have been added. (note) In my plan for my net art piece 
I would develp an algorithm to make sure that images do not overlap each other until it is neccisary (I run out of room)</p>
    
    
    
        
              <h2>Our canvas now....  </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="back40.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
    </div>
      
    
              <h2>And now with more reviews being added </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="back50.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
    </div>
          
    

        
              <h2>And now with EVEN MORE </h2>
    
    <div align="left">
      <img src="back60.png" alt=""/>
  <br>  
    </div>
      
    
    <br> 
    <p> and that is a wrap! That is the plan for my net art piece! I hope you like it! :) </p>
