      <img src="box_threshold_1.gif" alt=""/>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
 <p> for this image I chose a threshold value of 1. This is because it is at this threshold value
   that I can seee the text conceiled by the image </p>

 <img src="cat_threshold_98.png" alt=""/>
 </div>
   <br>
  <br>
  <br>
 <p> for this image I chose a threshold value of 98. This is because it is at this threshold value that
I believe the cat looks fully like a cat. My reasoning for this is that all cats can be recognized by their unusal 
slit eyes. I beleive that it is exactly at threshold 98 that we can see that eye very clearly</p>
 </div>
 <div align="left">
 <img src="writing_threshold_105.jpg" alt/>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
 <p> for this image I chose a threshold value of 105. I chose this value because the text is now black and the background
   is white and there is a minimal ammount of noise in the image. I do not believe that there is a single "best" threshold 
   image. This is because the threshold of this image is very much a spectrum. Choosing a threshold value of 104 or 106 
   would produce a very similar image. Besides that, the ammount of acceptable "noise" whitest background and backest text
   is arbitrary as well. </p>

 <div align="left">   
 <img src="sheet_music_edges_found.jpg" alt=""/>
    
   
<br>
 <p> there are a few flaws in the enhanced image. One of the flaws (that I believe is a flaw) is that it seems that 
   the image (perhaps a photocopy) has another page behind it that is slightly (even if translucently so) visible. 
   Another flaw is that not every single edge was found in that many of our quarter/ eigth notes are still black instead
   of hollow. From a person who would want to play this sheet music another flaw is the reduced visibility and probably 
   confusion that this page would cause</p>
