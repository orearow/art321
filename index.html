      <h3> <b>Artist</b> <h3>
        
      <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg/275px-Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg" alt="Mona Lisa" style="padding-bottom:50px;">
        <p>Among the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are his <i><b>innovative</b></i> techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in <i><b>physiognomy</b></i> and the way humans register <i><b>emotion</b></i> in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, <i><b>the Mona Lisa</b></i>, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.</p>

      <h3> <b>Anatomist</b> <h3>

        <p>Leonardo's anatomical drawings include many studies of the human <i><b>skeleton</b></i> and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the <i><b>heart</b></i> and vascular system, the <i><b>sex organs</b></i> and other internal organs, making one of the <i><b>first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero</b></i>. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.</p>

      <h3> <b>Writter</b> <h3>

      <p>
        One remarkable indication that Leonardo was <i><b>dyslexic</b></i> is in his handwriting. Leonardo was constantly sketching out his ideas for inventions. Most of the time, <i><b>he wrote his notes in reverse</b></i>. Leonardo’s spelling is also considered erratic and quite <i><b>strange</b></i>. He also started many more projects then he ever finished – a characteristic now often associated with <i><b>attention deficit disorder</b></i> (ADHD).

    <div id="invent-content" style="display:none;">
      <h3> <b>Inventor</b> <h3>
        
      <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="http://www.livescience.com/images/i/000/072/908/i02/da-vinci-flying-machine.jpg?1419022148?interpolation=lanczos-none&downsize=640:*" alt="machine" style="padding-bottom:50px;">
      <p>Leonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of <i><b>flight</b></i> for much of his life, producing many studies, including <i><b>Codex on the Flight of Birds</b></i> (c. 1505), as well as plans for several flying machines such as a flapping ornithopter and a machine with a <i><b>helical rotor</b></i>. The British television station Channel Four commissioned a 2003 documentary, Leonardo's Dream Machines, in which various designs by Leonardo, such as a parachute and a giant crossbow, were interpreted, constructed and tested. Some of those designs proved <i><b>successful</b></i>, whilst others fared less well when practically tested.</p>

      <h3> <b>Musician</b> <h3>
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/72/61/26/726126dbb25922e285f6901bf3c12095.jpg" alt="instrument" style="padding-bottom:50px;">
        
      <p>
        here is quite a bit of truth in the stories that Leonardo was a skilled poet, singer and <i><b>practiced musician</b></i>.
        We know he played a number of musical instruments including the <i><b>lira da braccia</b></i> and the lyre. Time and again biographers speak of how he designed a <i><b>silver lyre</b></i> in the shape of a horses head which was said to be more resonant and have a more beautiful sound than conventional wooden lyres.
