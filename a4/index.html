<h1>Assignment 4 - animation</h1>

   <br>
  <br>
  <br>
 <p> For this assignment I animated an explosion. My explosion is created by a witch that has a mishap with her cauldron. <p>
 
 <h2> Here are my early sketches </h2>
 <h3> Sketch 1 </h3>
   <div align="left">
      <img src="sketch1.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p> in this sketch I added lots of detail to the witch and had her reading from a spellbook.
      My ambitious plan was to have her flip the pages of the book </p> 
  <br>
  </div>
   <h3> Sketch 2 </h3>

    <div align="left">
      <img src="sketch2.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p> in this sketch I made my witch less detailed and zoomed out of the scene </p> 
  <br>
  </div>
  <h3> Sketch 3 (digital sketch) </h3>

    <div align="left">
      <img src="sketch3.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p> this is the first digital sketch I made. I realized that things are harder to create digitally with a wonky stylus and ipad
      than a pen and paper so my witch lost detail and my design became much more simplistic </p>
