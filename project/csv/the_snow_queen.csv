117,The Snow Queen,gerda,
114,The Snow Queen,little,A little boy and a little girl  ~newline~ In the big city  where there are so many houses and people so that there is not enough space for everyone to have a little garden  and where most people for that reason have to make do with flowers in pots  there were two poor children who nevertheless had a garden that was a bit bigger than a flowerpot  ~newline~ The windows were often completely frozen shut  but they would heat small copper coins on the tiled stove  place a hot coin on the frozen windowpane and it would form so round  perfectly round a fine peephole  behind which a wonderfully mild eye would peer out  one from each window   that of the little boy and the little girl  ~newline~  Do they also have a bee queen   the little boy asked  for he knew that among real bees there is such a queen  ~newline~  Can the Snow Queen come in here   the little girl asked  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ The little boy took fright and jumped down from the chair  it was as if a large bird flew past the window  ~newline~ The roses bloomed so marvellously that summer  the little girl had learnt a hymn and it talked of roses  and when she read that she thought about her own roses  and she sang it for the little boy  and he joined in  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ and now I ve got something in my eye   The little girl held him by the neck  he blinked his eyes  no  there was nothing to be seen  ~newline~  Kay  what are you doing   the little girl shouted  and when he saw how shocked she was  he pulled another rose off and then rushed inside from his window  away from sweet little Gerda  ~newline~ Everything that was a bit odd about them and not very fetching Kay was able to imitate  and then people said   That boy s certainly got a clever head on his shoulders   but it was the piece of glass he had got in his eye  the glass that was lodged in his heart  that was why he teased even little Gerda  who loved him with all her soul  ~newline~ Then the snow started to fall so thick and fast that the little boy couldn t see a hand in front of his face  while he hurtled along   then he quickly let go of the string to free    himself from the big sleigh  but that didn t help him a bit  his little sledge was still attached and he was travelling as fast as the wind  ~newline~ The Snow Queen kissed Kay once more  and then he had forgotten little Gerda and grandmother and all of them back home  ~newline~ The flower garden of the woman who knew the art of sorcery But how were things with little Gerda  now that Kay no longer came  ~newline~ No one knew where he was  many tears were shed  little Gerda wept profoundly and a long time    then they said that he was dead  had drowned in the river that ran close to the city  oh  these were drawn out  dismal winter days  ~newline~  Kay is dead and gone   little Gerda said  ~newline~  I don t believe it   they answered  and finally little Gerda didn t either  ~newline~  Is it true that you have taken my little playmate  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~ Then little Gerda felt quite scared and started to cry  but no one heard her except the house sparrows  and they could not carry her back to the shore  but they flew alongside it and sang  as if to comfort her   Here we are  ~newline~ here we are   The boat drifted with the current  little Gerda sat quite still in her stockinged feet  her small red shoes floated behind  but they couldn t reach the boat  it started to move faster  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~  You poor little child   the old woman said   how on earth have you ended up on the swift flowing river  carried far out into the great  wide world   and the old woman went right out into the water  caught hold of the boat with the curved end of her stick  pulled it ashore and lifted little Gerda out  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~    I ve so longed to have such a sweet little girl   the old woman said  ~newline~  Now you shall see how well the two of us are going to get on with each other   and while she combed little Gerda s hair  Gerda forgot more and more her playmate Kay  for the old woman was a sorceress  but not an evil one  she only did magic for her own pleasure  and now she wanted to keep little Gerda  ~newline~ The old woman was afraid that when Gerda saw the roses  she would think of her own and then remember little Kay and run away  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~  Oh  how long I ve been delayed   the little girl said  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~ Can the heart s flame die in the flames of the funeral pyre    I don t understand that at all   little Gerda said  ~newline~  Isn t he on his way yet     Do you mean Kay   little Gerda asked  ~newline~ The little black dog  as light as the bubbles  gets up on its hind legs and wants to join them on the swing  it flies  the dog tumbles down  barks and is angry  it s been duped  the bubbles burst   my song is a swinging board  a bursting picture of foam    What you tell me may well be beautiful  but you say things in such a mournful way and don t mention Kay at all  ~newline~   The flower scent says they are corpses  the angelus rings out over the dead    You make me feel quite sad   little Gerda said  ~newline~ ah  is little Kay really dead  ~newline~  You are a bright little sun   Gerda said  ~newline~ Now that was my little story   the buttercup said  ~newline~  Yes  she s sure to be longing for me  worried about me as she was for little Kay  ~newline~   Asking the flowers isn t any help  all they know is their own song  they can t tell me anything   And so she tied up her little skirt  so that she could run faster  but the narcissus struck her over the leg as she jumped over it  then she stopped up  looked at the tall yellow flower and asked   Do you know something  perhaps   and bent down to it  ~newline~   Up in the small attic room  half dressed  a little dancer is standing  now she s standing on one leg  now on two  and kicks her heels at the whole world  she is merely an optical illusion  ~newline~ The door was shut  but she wriggled the rusty hasp till it came loose  and the door sprung open  and then little Gerda ran off on her bare feet into the great wide world  ~newline~  Good lord  how delayed I am   little Gerda said   It s autumn already  ~newline~ goodday   That was the best it could manage  but it was so well meaning with the little girl and it asked her where she was heading alone in the great wide world  ~newline~ could well be    What  do you really think so   the little girl shouted and almost squeezed the crow to death  so fervently did she kiss it  ~newline~  I think I know    I think it might just be little Kay  ~newline~ The wisest of them had admittedly taken some sandwiches with them  but they didn t share them with the man next to them  for they thought  Just let him look hungry  then the princess won t take him    But Kay  little Kay   Gerda asked  ~newline~ it was on the third day when a little fellow turned up  without horse or carriage  marching quite unperturbed right up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had lovely long hair  but apart from that poor clothes    That was Kay   Gerda shouted with joy  ~newline~ The servant s servant s page  who always wears slippers  is almost impossible to look at  so proudly does he stand at the door    That must be horrible   little Gerda said  ~newline~ I ll have a word with my tame sweetheart  she can surely advise us  for I must tell you that you  such a little girl as yourself  will never be allowed to get properly inside    Oh yes  I will   Gerda said  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ Now they were on the staircase  a little lamp was burning on a cupboard  in the middle of the floor stood the tame crow and it turned its head in all directions and observed Gerda  who curtseyed  as her grandmother had taught her  ~newline~     My fianc  has said such nice things about you  little miss   the tame crow said   your Vita  as it is called  is also extremely moving  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~   She called his name out quite loud  held the lamp closer to him   the dreams swished on horseback back into the room   he woke up  turned his head and     it wasn t little Kay  ~newline~ Then little Gerda cried and told them her entire story and everything that the crows had done for her  ~newline~  You poor little thing   the prince and princess said  and they praised the crows and said they weren t the slightest bit angry with them  but they shouldn t make a habit of it  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ The little robber girl  ~newline~ it s gold   they shouted  rushed forwards  seized the horses  killed the small jockeys  the coachman and the servants and then pulled little Gerda out of the carriage  ~newline~  She s as good as a little fattened lamb  ~newline~  Ow   the old woman suddenly cried out  she had been bitten in the ear by her own little daughter  who hung on her back and was so wild and unkempt it was a joy to see  ~newline~  You nasty little brat   her mother said and forgot about slaughtering Gerda  ~newline~  She s to play with me   the little robber girl said  ~newline~  She s to give me her muff  her beautiful dress  sleep with me in my bed   and she bit her mother again  so the robber woman leapt into the air and turned round  and all the robbers laughed and said   See  how she dances with her young brat    I want to go inside the coach   the little robber girl said and simply had to have her will  for she was so spoilt and so stubborn  ~newline~ The little robber girl was as big as Gerda  but stronger  more broadshouldered and dark skinned  her eyes were quite black  so they almost looked sad  ~newline~ Are you really a princess    No   little Gerda said and told her everything she had experienced  and how fond she was of little Kay  ~newline~  They are all mine   the little robber girl said and swiftly grabbed one of those closest  held it by its legs and shook it  so that it flapped its wings  ~newline~ Every single evening I tickle his throat with my sharp knife   he s so afraid of that   and the little girl pulled a long knife out of a cleft in the wall and let it glide over the reindeer s neck  the poor animal kicked out with its legs  and the robber girl laughed and pulled down Gerda with her onto the bed  ~newline~  I always sleep with a knife   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ But say again what you told me about little Kay  and why you set out into the great wide world   And Gerda told her from the beginning  and the pigeons cooed up there in their cage   the other pigeons slept  ~newline~ The little robber girl placed her arm round Gerda s neck  held the knife in the other hand and fell noisily asleep  but Gerda simply couldn t close her eyes  she didn t know if she was going to live or die  ~newline~ it was quite terrible for the little girl to watch  ~newline~ we ve seen little Kay  ~newline~ there the snow queen has her summer tent  but her permanent palace is up near the North Pole  on the island they call Spitsbergen    Oh Kay  little Kay   Gerda sighed  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~ The robber girl lifted little Gerda up and took the precaution of binding her  even of giving her a cushion to sit on  ~newline~  I can t stand you blubbering like that   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ and here are two loaves and a ham for you  so you won t go hungry   Both were fixed behind her on the reindeer  the little robber girl opened the door  enticed all the big dogs inside  and then she cut through the rope and said to the reindeer   Off you run  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~    First the reindeer told its story  then little Gerda s  and the Finnmark woman blinked her wise eyes  but didn t say anything  ~newline~ Won t you give the little girl a potion  so she can have the strength of twelve men and overpower the Snow Queen    The strength of twelve men   the Finnmark woman said   yes  that should do the trick   and she went over to a shelf  took out a large rolled up hide and unrolled it  on it strange letters were written  and the Finnmark woman read away till the sweat poured down her forehead  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ If she is unable of her own accord to get to the Snow Queen and remove the glass from little Kay  we cannot help her to do so  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ It is true that wasn t thinking of little Gerda  least of all that she was standing outside the palace  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ dear little Kay  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ dear little Gerda  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her  ~newline~  You re a fine fellow to go traipsing around   she said to little Kay   I wonder if you re worth running to the ends of the world for   But Gerda patted her on the cheek  and asked about the prince and princess  ~newline~  But the crow   little Gerda asked  ~newline~ Grandmother was sitting in God s bright sunshine and was reading out loud from the Bible   Unless you become as little children  you will not enter the kingdom of Heaven   And Kay and Gerda looked into each other s eyes  and suddenly they understood the old hymn  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail 
111,The Snow Queen,said,It was most amusing   the devil  said  ~newline~ Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~  They are white bees that are swarming   the old grandmother said  ~newline~  They do indeed   the grandmother said  ~newline~ On many a winter night she flies through the city streets and looks in through the windows  and then they freeze over so strangely  as if with flowers    Yes  I ve seen that   both the children said  and so they knew it was true  ~newline~  Just let her try and come in  the boy said   and I ll put her on the hot stove  and then she ll melt   But the grandmother smoothed his hair and told them other stories  ~newline~ It was when Kay and Gerda sat there looking at a picture book with animals and birds   the clock was just striking five on the great church steeple   that Kay said   Ow  something s stuck me in the heart  ~newline~  I think it s out again   he said   but it wasn t  ~newline~ When she later came with the picture book  he said that it was only for babies  and if the grandmother told them stories  he always came up with some objection   and if he could  he would follow after her  put a pair of glasses on and speak exactly the way she did   so convincingly that it made people laugh at him  ~newline~ Everything that was a bit odd about them and not very fetching Kay was able to imitate  and then people said   That boy s certainly got a clever head on his shoulders   but it was the piece of glass he had got in his eye  the glass that was lodged in his heart  that was why he teased even little Gerda  who loved him with all her soul  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~  See  how ingenious   Kay said   it s much more interesting than real flowers are  ~newline~  We ve arrived safely   she said   but do you call that freezing  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ No one knew where he was  many tears were shed  little Gerda wept profoundly and a long time    then they said that he was dead  had drowned in the river that ran close to the city  oh  these were drawn out  dismal winter days  ~newline~  Kay is dead and gone   little Gerda said  ~newline~  I don t believe it   the sunshine said  ~newline~  He s dead and gone   she said to the swallows  ~newline~  I ll put on my new  red shoes   she said one morning   Kay s never seen them  and I ll go down to the river and ask it     And it was quite early  she kissed the old grandmother  who was asleep  put on the red shoes and went all on her own out of the city gate to the river  ~newline~  You poor little child   the old woman said   how on earth have you ended up on the swift flowing river  carried far out into the great  wide world   and the old woman went right out into the water  caught hold of the boat with the curved end of her stick  pulled it ashore and lifted little Gerda out  ~newline~  Come and tell me who you are  and how you come to be here   she said  ~newline~ And Gerda told her everything  and the old woman shook her head and said  Hm  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~    I ve so longed to have such a sweet little girl   the old woman said  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~  Oh  how long I ve been delayed   the little girl said  ~newline~  Do you think he is dead and gone    He s not dead   the roses said  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~ Can the heart s flame die in the flames of the funeral pyre    I don t understand that at all   little Gerda said  ~newline~  That is my fairytale   the orange lily said  ~newline~   The flower scent says they are corpses  the angelus rings out over the dead    You make me feel quite sad   little Gerda said  ~newline~  You are a bright little sun   Gerda said  ~newline~ Now that was my little story   the buttercup said  ~newline~ I can see myself   the narcissus said  ~newline~ I can see myself    I don t care about that   Gerda said  ~newline~  Good lord  how delayed I am   little Gerda said   It s autumn already  ~newline~ Gerda had to take another rest  then a large crow hopped over the snow opposite where she sat  after sitting there for a long while  looking at her and waggling its head it said   Caw  ~newline~    Steady now  steady now   the crow said  ~newline~  Yes  listen   the crow said   but it s hard for me to talk your language  ~newline~ If you understand crow language  I can tell you better    No  I ve not learnt it   Gerda said   but grandmother knew it  and she knew P language too  ~newline~ If only I had learnt it    No matter   the crow said   I ll tell you as best I can  but it won t be all that good even so   and then he told her what he knew  ~newline~ So she had all her ladies in waiting drummed together  and when they heard what she wanted  they were so pleased   I like this   they said   I was thinking something similar only the other day     Believe you me  every word I m telling you is the truth   the crow said  ~newline~   Yes  yes   the crow said   believe you me  it is certain as I m sitting here  people flocked to the palace  there was such a hustle and bustle  but there was no success on either the first or the second day  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ I was in there to have a look myself   the crow said  ~newline~  He had a small knapsack on his back   the crow said  ~newline~  No  that must have been his sledge   Gerda said   for he had a sledge with him when he left       That may well be   the crow said   I didn t look all that closely  ~newline~ but I know from my tame sweetheart that when he came in at the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all in silver and on the staircase the footmen all in gold  he wasn t the slightest bit overawed  he nodded and said to them   It must be boring standing on the stairs  I think I d rather go inside   There he came to halls glittering with light  privy councillors and excellencies walked around on their bare feet and carried gold dishes   the more ceremony the better  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~ The servant s servant s page  who always wears slippers  is almost impossible to look at  so proudly does he stand at the door    That must be horrible   little Gerda said  ~newline~ It s Kay all right   Gerda said   he was so clever he could do mental arithmetic with fractions  ~newline~   Oh  won t you take me in where the palace lies    Yes  that s easily said   the crow replied  ~newline~ I ll have a word with my tame sweetheart  she can surely advise us  for I must tell you that you  such a little girl as yourself  will never be allowed to get properly inside    Oh yes  I will   Gerda said  ~newline~  When Kay hears that I am here  he will come out immediately and fetch me    Wait for me at the stile over there   the crow said  waggled its head and flew off  ~newline~ rah   it said  ~newline~     My fianc  has said such nice things about you  little miss   the tame crow said   your Vita  as it is called  is also extremely moving  ~newline~ We will take the direct route  for we will not encounter anyone there    I think I can hear someone right behind us   Gerda said  and it swished past her  it was like shadows along the wall  horses with flowing manes and thin legs  hunting lads  gentlemen and ladies on horseback  ~newline~  It s only dreams   the crow said   they ve come to fetch the thoughts of the royal household out hunting  a good thing as you can then more easily observe them in bed  ~newline~ But let me see  if you gain glory and honour  that you then display a grateful heart    That s nothing to talk about   said the crow from the forest  ~newline~  You poor little thing   the prince and princess said  and they praised the crows and said they weren t the slightest bit angry with them  but they shouldn t make a habit of it  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~  She s plump  she s fine  she s fattened with nut kernels   said the old robber woman  who had a long  wiry whiskers and eyebrows that hung down over her eyes  ~newline~  You nasty little brat   her mother said and forgot about slaughtering Gerda  ~newline~  She s to play with me   the little robber girl said  ~newline~  She s to give me her muff  her beautiful dress  sleep with me in my bed   and she bit her mother again  so the robber woman leapt into the air and turned round  and all the robbers laughed and said   See  how she dances with her young brat    I want to go inside the coach   the little robber girl said and simply had to have her will  for she was so spoilt and so stubborn  ~newline~ She took Gerda by the waist and said   They re not going to kill you  as long as I don t get angry with you  ~newline~ Are you really a princess    No   little Gerda said and told her everything she had experienced  and how fond she was of little Kay  ~newline~ The robber girl looked at her very seriously  nodded slightly and said   They are not going to kill you  and if I nevertheless should happen to get angry with you  I d rather do it myself   and then she dried Gerda s eyes and stuffed both her hands in the lovely muff  which was so soft and so warm  ~newline~  You re to sleep with me here along with all my small animals   the robber girl said  ~newline~  They are all mine   the little robber girl said and swiftly grabbed one of those closest  held it by its legs and shook it  so that it flapped its wings  ~newline~  Are you going to have the knife with you when you sleep   Gerda said and gave it a rather scared look  ~newline~  I always sleep with a knife   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ Then the woodpigeons said  Coo  coo  ~newline~ just ask the reindeer who s bound on the rope    There s ice and snow there  it s wonderful and marvellous there   the reindeer said   there you can run around freely in the vast gleaming valleys  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~  Who could know better than I can   the animal said  and its eyes rolled in its head  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~  It s all the same   she said   here are your furry boots  for it will be cold  but I ll keep the muff myself  it s too delightful  ~newline~  I can t stand you blubbering like that   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ and here are two loaves and a ham for you  so you won t go hungry   Both were fixed behind her on the reindeer  the little robber girl opened the door  enticed all the big dogs inside  and then she cut through the rope and said to the reindeer   Off you run  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~ whoosh   it said up in the sky  ~newline~  Those are my old northern lights   the reindeer said   just look at how they gleam   and it shot off even faster  night and day  the loaves were eaten  the ham too and then they were in Lapland  ~newline~  Oh  you poor things   the Lapp woman said   in that case you still have a long way to go  ~newline~ whoosh   it said up in the sky  all night long the loveliest blue northern lights gleamed    and then they came to Finnmark and knocked on the chimney of the Finnmark woman  for she didn t even have a door  ~newline~  You are so wise   the reindeer said   I know you can tie up all the winds in the world on a piece of sewing thread  if the skipper undoes the one knot  he gets a fair wind  if he undoes the other  it blows hard  and if he undoes the third and fourth  there is such a gale that the forests blow down  ~newline~ Won t you give the little girl a potion  so she can have the strength of twelve men and overpower the Snow Queen    The strength of twelve men   the Finnmark woman said   yes  that should do the trick   and she went over to a shelf  took out a large rolled up hide and unrolled it  on it strange letters were written  and the Finnmark woman read away till the sweat poured down her forehead  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ In the very middle of the empty endless snow hall there was a frozen lake  it had cracked into a thousand pieces  but each piece resembled the next one completely  so that it was nothing less than a feat  and in the middle of it the Snow Queen sat when at home  and then she said that she sat in the mirror of reason  and that this was the only and best thing in the world  ~newline~ he composed whole figures which were a written word   but he never succeeded in forming the exact word that he wanted  the word Eternity  and the Snow Queen had said   If you can make that word out for me  you shall be your own master  and I will make you a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates   But he was unable to  ~newline~  Now I m going to swish off to the warm countries   the Snow Queen said   I want to look down into the black cauldrons     These were the fire spewing mountains of Etna and Vesuvius  as they are called  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ how empty and huge it is here   and he held on tight to Gerda  and she laughed and cried with joy  it was so wonderful that even the pieces of ice danced around with joy and when they were tired and lay down  they formed precisely the combination of letters the Snow Queen had said he was to try to find  so now he was his own master  and she would have to make him a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman  ~newline~  Goodbye  they all said to each other  ~newline~  You re a fine fellow to go traipsing around   she said to little Kay   I wonder if you re worth running to the ends of the world for   But Gerda patted her on the cheek  and asked about the prince and princess  ~newline~  They ve left for abroad   the robber girl said  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
72,The Snow Queen,kay,
63,The Snow Queen,one,one of the very worst   it was  the devil   ~newline~ The loveliest landscapes looked like boiled spinach in it  and the best of people turned ugly or stood on their heads with no stomach  their faces became so distorted that they were unrecognisable  and if someone had a freckle  you could be sure that it spread out over both nose and mouth  ~newline~ Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ Some pieces of the mirror were so large that they were used for window panes  but it wasn t worth looking at one s friends through that pane  others were put in spectacles  and things went badly when people put on those glasses so as to see clearly and be just  the evil ogre laughed till his stomach burst  and that tickled him so wonderfully  ~newline~ In the big city  where there are so many houses and people so that there is not enough space for everyone to have a little garden  and where most people for that reason have to make do with flowers in pots  there were two poor children who nevertheless had a garden that was a bit bigger than a flowerpot  ~newline~ Their parents lived close to each other  they lived in two attics  where the roof from one next door house met that of the other and the gutter followed the eaves  a small window faced outwards from each house  you only needed to step over the gutter to get from the one window to the other  ~newline~   Outside the windows both their parents had a large wooden box where they grew the vegetables they needed as well as a small rose tree   there was one in each box and they grew there so beautifully  ~newline~ The parents came to place the boxes across the gutter so that they almost reached from one window to the other and they looked almost exactly like two embankments of flowers  ~newline~ The windows were often completely frozen shut  but they would heat small copper coins on the tiled stove  place a hot coin on the frozen windowpane and it would form so round  perfectly round a fine peephole  behind which a wonderfully mild eye would peer out  one from each window   that of the little boy and the little girl  ~newline~ In the summer they could get together by taking one big step  in the winter they first had to go down many stairs and up many stairs   outside the snow was swirling  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ The next day there was a clear frost    and then it began to thaw  the sun shone  everything turned green  the swallows built their nests  the windows were opened  and the small children sat once more in their tiny garden high up in the gutter above all the storeys of the houses  ~newline~ For it was one of the specks of glass that came from the mirror  the magic mirror   remember   the horrid glass that made everything large and good that was reflected in it become tiny and horrible  but what was evil and nasty became more obvious  and everything wrong with something was immediately noticeable  ~newline~ A tiny shard had also gone right into poor Kay s heart  ~newline~ and look  that one s all crooked  ~newline~ He was soon able to follow everyone in the whole street and mimic them  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ Then he shouted very loudly  but no one heard him  and the snow whirled past and the sledge flew along  from time to time it gave a leap   it was as if he was travelling over ditches and fences  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~  My sledge  don t forget my sledge   he only remembered that now  and it was attached to one of the white hens  and it flew behind with the sledge on its back  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~   No one knew  no one had anything to tell  ~newline~ No one knew where he was  many tears were shed  little Gerda wept profoundly and a long time    then they said that he was dead  had drowned in the river that ran close to the city  oh  these were drawn out  dismal winter days  ~newline~  Kay is dead and gone   little Gerda said  ~newline~  He s dead and gone   she said to the swallows  ~newline~  I ll put on my new  red shoes   she said one morning   Kay s never seen them  and I ll go down to the river and ask it     And it was quite early  she kissed the old grandmother  who was asleep  put on the red shoes and went all on her own out of the city gate to the river  ~newline~ Then little Gerda felt quite scared and started to cry  but no one heard her except the house sparrows  and they could not carry her back to the shore  but they flew alongside it and sang  as if to comfort her   Here we are  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~ Gerda called out even louder  and then and old  old woman came out of the house  leaning on a stick curved at one end  she was wearing a large sun bonnet  and on it the loveliest of flowers had been painted  ~newline~ The windows were high up and their panes were red  blue and yellow  the daylight shone so strangely inside there with every colour  but on the table were the loveliest cherries  and Gerda ate as many as she wished  for she dared to do so  ~newline~ And while she was eating  the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb  and her hair curled and shone so beautifully round the small  friendly face that was so round and resembled a rose  ~newline~  Now you shall see how well the two of us are going to get on with each other   and while she combed little Gerda s hair  Gerda forgot more and more her playmate Kay  for the old woman was a sorceress  but not an evil one  she only did magic for her own pleasure  and now she wanted to keep little Gerda  ~newline~ That was why she went out into the garden  stretched her curved stick out towards all the rose trees  and  no matter how beautifully they were blooming  they all sank down into the black earth and no one could see where they had once stood  ~newline~ Gerda knew every kind of flower  but no matter how many there were  she felt that one was missing  but which one she was unable to say  ~newline~ Then one day she was sitting looking at the old woman s sun bonnet with the flowers painted on it  and the most beautiful of them all happened to be a rose  ~newline~ But that s how it goes  when one hasn t collected all one s thoughts  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~  Do you think he is dead and gone    He s not dead   the roses said  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~   In her long  red sari the Hindu wife stands on the pyre  the flames rise up around her and her dead husband  but the Hindu woman thinks of the living one here in the circle  of him whose eyes burn more fiercely than the flames  of him whose eyes  fire reach her heart more than the flames that soon will turn her body into ashes  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for in one hand he is holding a small bowl  in the other a clay pipe  he is blowing soapbubbles  the swing swings  and the soap bubbles fly out in lovely  changing colours  the last one is still hanging on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~ What do the hyacinths say    There were three lovely sisters  so transparent and fine  the first one s dress was red  the second one s blue and the third one s completely white  hand in hand they danced by the still lake in the bright moonlight  ~newline~ we are just singing our song  the only one we know   And Gerda went over to the buttercup  which could be seen gleaming among the shiny  green leaves  ~newline~  Tell me if you know where I can find my playmate   And the buttercup shone so beautifully and looked at Gerda once more  ~newline~  Down into a small yard God s sun shone so warmly on the first day of spring  its rays slid down the neighbour s white wall  close by the first yellow flowers were growing   gleaming gold in the warm rays of the sun   old grandmother was outside in her chair  her granddaughter   the poor  lovely maid servant   came home on a short visit  she kissed her grandmother  ~newline~   Up in the small attic room  half dressed  a little dancer is standing  now she s standing on one leg  now on two  and kicks her heels at the whole world  she is merely an optical illusion  ~newline~ see how she struts on one stem  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~ goodday   That was the best it could manage  but it was so well meaning with the little girl and it asked her where she was heading alone in the great wide world  ~newline~ The world  alone  Gerda understood perfectly well and was well aware how much meaning lay in it  and so she told the crow about herself and her entire life and asked it if it hadn t seen Kay  ~newline~ The other day she s sitting on the throne  and that is not all that much fun  people say  when she happens to start humming a tune that is precisely this one   Why shouldn t I get married    Hey  that s not a bad idea   she says  and was so eager to get married  but she wanted to have a husband that knew how to answer back when talked to  one that didn t just stand there looking fine   for that s so boring  ~newline~  The newspapers immediately came out edged with hearts and the princess s monogram  there people could read that any young man who was handsome was free to come up to the palace and speak with the princess  and the one who spoke in such a way that one could hear he belonged there  and who spoke best  the princess would take as her husband  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ it was on the third day when a little fellow turned up  without horse or carriage  marching quite unperturbed right up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had lovely long hair  but apart from that poor clothes    That was Kay   Gerda shouted with joy  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~ He would of course be glad to see her  hear about the long way she had come for his sake  know how sorrowful everyone at home had been when he didn t return  ~newline~ We will take the direct route  for we will not encounter anyone there    I think I can hear someone right behind us   Gerda said  and it swished past her  it was like shadows along the wall  horses with flowing manes and thin legs  hunting lads  gentlemen and ladies on horseback  ~newline~ Each hall was finer than the previous one  yes  it really took one s breath away  and now they were in the bedroom  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~ Then little Gerda cried and told them her entire story and everything that the crows had done for her  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ And she was given both boots and a muff  she was so finely clothed  and when she wanted to set off  a new coach of pure gold was standing at the door  the arms of the prince and princess shone from it like a star  coachman  servants and postilions   for there were also postilions   sat dressed in golden crowns  ~newline~ They drove through the dark forest  but the coach shone like a torch  it dazzled the robbers  and that they couldn t stomach  ~newline~ In the large  old  sooty hall a large fire was burning in the middle of the stone floor  the smoke gathered up under the roof and had to find its own way out  a large cauldron of soup was stewing  and both hares and rabbits were being turned on a spit  ~newline~  They are all mine   the little robber girl said and swiftly grabbed one of those closest  held it by its legs and shook it  so that it flapped its wings  ~newline~ they ll fly off at once if one doesn t have them securely behind bars  and here s my dear old Pooh   and she pulled out by the antlers a reindeer that had a shiny copper ring round its neck and was bound  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~  You are so wise   the reindeer said   I know you can tie up all the winds in the world on a piece of sewing thread  if the skipper undoes the one knot  he gets a fair wind  if he undoes the other  it blows hard  and if he undoes the third and fourth  there is such a gale that the forests blow down  ~newline~ The northern lights gleamed so precisely that one could tell when they were turned right up and when they were screwed right down  ~newline~ In the very middle of the empty endless snow hall there was a frozen lake  it had cracked into a thousand pieces  but each piece resembled the next one completely  so that it was nothing less than a feat  and in the middle of it the Snow Queen sat when at home  and then she said that she sat in the mirror of reason  and that this was the only and best thing in the world  ~newline~ And Gerda kissed his cheeks  and they started to bloom  she kissed his eyes  and they shone like hers  she kissed his hands and feet  and he was strong and healthy  ~newline~ And they took each other by the hand and walked out of the large palace  they talked about grandmother and about the roses up on the roof  and wherever they walked  the winds died down and sun came out  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  the reindeer was standing there waiting for them  it had another young reindeer with it with a full udder  and it gave the young ones its warm milk and kissed them on the lips  ~newline~   But tell me how things have gone for you  and how you managed to get hold of him   And both Gerda and Kay told her 
41,The Snow Queen,could,The loveliest landscapes looked like boiled spinach in it  and the best of people turned ugly or stood on their heads with no stomach  their faces became so distorted that they were unrecognisable  and if someone had a freckle  you could be sure that it spread out over both nose and mouth  ~newline~ Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ In the summer they could get together by taking one big step  in the winter they first had to go down many stairs and up many stairs   outside the snow was swirling  ~newline~ When she later came with the picture book  he said that it was only for babies  and if the grandmother told them stories  he always came up with some objection   and if he could  he would follow after her  put a pair of glasses on and speak exactly the way she did   so convincingly that it made people laugh at him  ~newline~ Then the snow started to fall so thick and fast that the little boy couldn t see a hand in front of his face  while he hurtled along   then he quickly let go of the string to free    himself from the big sleigh  but that didn t help him a bit  his little sledge was still attached and he was travelling as fast as the wind  ~newline~ He was quite frightened  wanted to say his Lord s Prayer  but all he could remember was his multiplication table from ten to twenty  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ Where could he be  ~newline~ The boys could only say that they had seen him tie his small sledge to a magnificent large sleigh that drove off into the street and out at the city gate  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~ Then little Gerda felt quite scared and started to cry  but no one heard her except the house sparrows  and they could not carry her back to the shore  but they flew alongside it and sang  as if to comfort her   Here we are  ~newline~ here we are   The boat drifted with the current  little Gerda sat quite still in her stockinged feet  her small red shoes floated behind  but they couldn t reach the boat  it started to move faster  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~ That was why she went out into the garden  stretched her curved stick out towards all the rose trees  and  no matter how beautifully they were blooming  they all sank down into the black earth and no one could see where they had once stood  ~newline~ every conceivable flower  and for every season of the year  stood here in all its glory  no picture book could be more many coloured and lovely  ~newline~ The next day she could play again with the flowers in the warm sunshine   and many days passed like this  ~newline~ we are just singing our song  the only one we know   And Gerda went over to the buttercup  which could be seen gleaming among the shiny  green leaves  ~newline~ What song could the buttercup perhaps sing  ~newline~   Asking the flowers isn t any help  all they know is their own song  they can t tell me anything   And so she tied up her little skirt  so that she could run faster  but the narcissus struck her over the leg as she jumped over it  then she stopped up  looked at the tall yellow flower and asked   Do you know something  perhaps   and bent down to it  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ goodday   That was the best it could manage  but it was so well meaning with the little girl and it asked her where she was heading alone in the great wide world  ~newline~ could well be    What  do you really think so   the little girl shouted and almost squeezed the crow to death  so fervently did she kiss it  ~newline~  The newspapers immediately came out edged with hearts and the princess s monogram  there people could read that any young man who was handsome was free to come up to the palace and speak with the princess  and the one who spoke in such a way that one could hear he belonged there  and who spoke best  the princess would take as her husband  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ It was as if people in there had taken snuff and it had fallen onto their stomachs and they had fallen into a trance until they were back in the street   yes  then they could talk all right  ~newline~ It s Kay all right   Gerda said   he was so clever he could do mental arithmetic with fractions  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ And the prince got out of bed and let Gerda sleep in it   he could not do more  ~newline~ The forest crow  which had now got married  accompanied them the first twenty miles or so  it sat next to her  for it couldn t travel backwards  the other crow stood at the gate and flapped its wings  it didn t accompany them  for it had a headache  since it now had a permanent position and had eaten too much  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ They drove through the dark forest  but the coach shone like a torch  it dazzled the robbers  and that they couldn t stomach  ~newline~ Now the coach came to a stop  there in the middle of the courtyard of a robber s castle  there were great cracks in it from top to bottom  ravens and crows flew out of the open holes  and the huge fierce dogs  each of which looked as if it could swallow a whole human being  leapt high into the air  but they didn t bark  for that was forbidden  ~newline~ The little robber girl placed her arm round Gerda s neck  held the knife in the other hand and fell noisily asleep  but Gerda simply couldn t close her eyes  she didn t know if she was going to live or die  ~newline~  Who could know better than I can   the animal said  and its eyes rolled in its head  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~ The northern lights gleamed so precisely that one could tell when they were turned right up and when they were screwed right down  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman 
40,The Snow Queen,girl,A little boy and a little girl  ~newline~ The windows were often completely frozen shut  but they would heat small copper coins on the tiled stove  place a hot coin on the frozen windowpane and it would form so round  perfectly round a fine peephole  behind which a wonderfully mild eye would peer out  one from each window   that of the little boy and the little girl  ~newline~  Can the Snow Queen come in here   the little girl asked  ~newline~ The roses bloomed so marvellously that summer  the little girl had learnt a hymn and it talked of roses  and when she read that she thought about her own roses  and she sang it for the little boy  and he joined in  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ and now I ve got something in my eye   The little girl held him by the neck  he blinked his eyes  no  there was nothing to be seen  ~newline~  Kay  what are you doing   the little girl shouted  and when he saw how shocked she was  he pulled another rose off and then rushed inside from his window  away from sweet little Gerda  ~newline~    I ve so longed to have such a sweet little girl   the old woman said  ~newline~  Oh  how long I ve been delayed   the little girl said  ~newline~    Out over the narrow mountain road hangs an old baronial castle  dense periwinkles grow up round its old red walls  leaf by leaf  up around the balcony where a lovely girl stands  she leans out over the balustrade and gazes down the road  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for in one hand he is holding a small bowl  in the other a clay pipe  he is blowing soapbubbles  the swing swings  and the soap bubbles fly out in lovely  changing colours  the last one is still hanging on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~ There was such a sweet scent  and the girls went off into the forest  the scent grew stronger   three coffins  in which the lovely girls lay down  glided out from the thicket out across the lake  glow worms flew round them  glimmering like small floating lights  ~newline~ Are the dancing girls asleep  or are they dead  ~newline~  You have such a strong scent  I have to think of the dead girls  ~newline~ goodday   That was the best it could manage  but it was so well meaning with the little girl and it asked her where she was heading alone in the great wide world  ~newline~ could well be    What  do you really think so   the little girl shouted and almost squeezed the crow to death  so fervently did she kiss it  ~newline~ I ll have a word with my tame sweetheart  she can surely advise us  for I must tell you that you  such a little girl as yourself  will never be allowed to get properly inside    Oh yes  I will   Gerda said  ~newline~ The little robber girl  ~newline~  She s to play with me   the little robber girl said  ~newline~  She s to give me her muff  her beautiful dress  sleep with me in my bed   and she bit her mother again  so the robber woman leapt into the air and turned round  and all the robbers laughed and said   See  how she dances with her young brat    I want to go inside the coach   the little robber girl said and simply had to have her will  for she was so spoilt and so stubborn  ~newline~ The little robber girl was as big as Gerda  but stronger  more broadshouldered and dark skinned  her eyes were quite black  so they almost looked sad  ~newline~ The robber girl looked at her very seriously  nodded slightly and said   They are not going to kill you  and if I nevertheless should happen to get angry with you  I d rather do it myself   and then she dried Gerda s eyes and stuffed both her hands in the lovely muff  which was so soft and so warm  ~newline~  You re to sleep with me here along with all my small animals   the robber girl said  ~newline~ Above them      on lathes and perches  sat almost a hundred pigeons  all of which seemed to be asleep  although they turned slightly when the young girls came  ~newline~  They are all mine   the little robber girl said and swiftly grabbed one of those closest  held it by its legs and shook it  so that it flapped its wings  ~newline~ Every single evening I tickle his throat with my sharp knife   he s so afraid of that   and the little girl pulled a long knife out of a cleft in the wall and let it glide over the reindeer s neck  the poor animal kicked out with its legs  and the robber girl laughed and pulled down Gerda with her onto the bed  ~newline~  I always sleep with a knife   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ The little robber girl placed her arm round Gerda s neck  held the knife in the other hand and fell noisily asleep  but Gerda simply couldn t close her eyes  she didn t know if she was going to live or die  ~newline~ it was quite terrible for the little girl to watch  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~ The robber girl lifted little Gerda up and took the precaution of binding her  even of giving her a cushion to sit on  ~newline~  I can t stand you blubbering like that   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ and here are two loaves and a ham for you  so you won t go hungry   Both were fixed behind her on the reindeer  the little robber girl opened the door  enticed all the big dogs inside  and then she cut through the rope and said to the reindeer   Off you run  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~ Won t you give the little girl a potion  so she can have the strength of twelve men and overpower the Snow Queen    The strength of twelve men   the Finnmark woman said   yes  that should do the trick   and she went over to a shelf  took out a large rolled up hide and unrolled it  on it strange letters were written  and the Finnmark woman read away till the sweat poured down her forehead  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her  ~newline~  They ve left for abroad   the robber girl said  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
40,The Snow Queen,snow,In the summer they could get together by taking one big step  in the winter they first had to go down many stairs and up many stairs   outside the snow was swirling  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ The games he played were so different from before   they were so dictated by reason    One winter s day  when the snowflakes came swirling down  he came with a large burning glass  held out the corner of his blue coat and let the snowflakes fall on it  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~ Then the snow started to fall so thick and fast that the little boy couldn t see a hand in front of his face  while he hurtled along   then he quickly let go of the string to free    himself from the big sleigh  but that didn t help him a bit  his little sledge was still attached and he was travelling as fast as the wind  ~newline~ Then he shouted very loudly  but no one heard him  and the snow whirled past and the sledge flew along  from time to time it gave a leap   it was as if he was travelling over ditches and fences  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~ creep into my bear fur coat   and she placed him in the sleigh with her  wrapped the fur round him  it felt like sinking into a snowdrift  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~ What does the tiny snowdrop say  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for

on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~ Gerda had to take another rest  then a large crow hopped over the snow opposite where she sat  after sitting there for a long while  looking at her and waggling its head it said   Caw  ~newline~ Do you know anything about that    She s sure to have been on her way to Lapland  for there is always snow and ice there  ~newline~ just ask the reindeer who s bound on the rope    There s ice and snow there  it s wonderful and marvellous there   the reindeer said   there you can run around freely in the vast gleaming valleys  ~newline~ there the snow queen has her summer tent  but her permanent palace is up near the North Pole  on the island they call Spitsbergen    Oh Kay  little Kay   Gerda sighed  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck

undaunted  ~newline~ The walls of the palace were of whirling snow and its windows and doors of biting winds  there were more than a hundred halls  formed as the snow drifted  the largest stretching many miles  all of them lit by the brightest northern lights  and they were so large  so empty  so icy cold and so gleaming  ~newline~ In the very middle of the empty endless snow hall there was a frozen lake  it had cracked into a thousand pieces  but each piece resembled the next one completely  so that it was nothing less than a feat  and in the middle of it the Snow Queen sat when at home  and then she said that she sat in the mirror of reason  and that this was the only and best thing in the world 
39,The Snow Queen,woman,One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ The flower garden of the woman who knew the art of sorcery But how were things with little Gerda  now that Kay no longer came  ~newline~ Gerda called out even louder  and then and old  old woman came out of the house  leaning on a stick curved at one end  she was wearing a large sun bonnet  and on it the loveliest of flowers had been painted  ~newline~  You poor little child   the old woman said   how on earth have you ended up on the swift flowing river  carried far out into the great  wide world   and the old woman went right out into the water  caught hold of the boat with the curved end of her stick  pulled it ashore and lifted little Gerda out  ~newline~ And Gerda was glad to get back onto dry land  though a bit afraid of the strange  old woman  ~newline~ And Gerda told her everything  and the old woman shook her head and said  Hm  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~ Then she took Gerda by the hand  they went into the small house  and the old woman shut the door behind them  ~newline~ And while she was eating  the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb  and her hair curled and shone so beautifully round the small  friendly face that was so round and resembled a rose  ~newline~    I ve so longed to have such a sweet little girl   the old woman said  ~newline~  Now you shall see how well the two of us are going to get on with each other   and while she combed little Gerda s hair  Gerda forgot more and more her playmate Kay  for the old woman was a sorceress  but not an evil one  she only did magic for her own pleasure  and now she wanted to keep little Gerda  ~newline~ The old woman was afraid that when Gerda saw the roses  she would think of her own and then remember little Kay and run away  ~newline~ Then one day she was sitting looking at the old woman s sun bonnet with the flowers painted on it  and the most beautiful of them all happened to be a rose  ~newline~ The old woman had forgotten to take it off her bonnet when she spirited all the others down into the ground  ~newline~   In her long  red sari the Hindu wife stands on the pyre  the flames rise up around her and her dead husband  but the Hindu woman thinks of the living one here in the circle  of him whose eyes burn more fiercely than the flames  of him whose eyes  fire reach her heart more than the flames that soon will turn her body into ashes  ~newline~  She s plump  she s fine  she s fattened with nut kernels   said the old robber woman  who had a long  wiry whiskers and eyebrows that hung down over her eyes  ~newline~  Ow   the old woman suddenly cried out  she had been bitten in the ear by her own little daughter  who hung on her back and was so wild and unkempt it was a joy to see  ~newline~  She s to give me her muff  her beautiful dress  sleep with me in my bed   and she bit her mother again  so the robber woman leapt into the air and turned round  and all the robbers laughed and said   See  how she dances with her young brat    I want to go inside the coach   the little robber girl said and simply had to have her will  for she was so spoilt and so stubborn  ~newline~ The robbers were sitting round the fire  singing and drinking  and the old robber woman was doing somersaults  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ The Lapp woman and the Finnmark woman  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~  Oh  you poor things   the Lapp woman said   in that case you still have a long way to go  ~newline~ I ll write a few words on some split cod  I haven t any paper  I ll give it to you for the Finnmark woman up there  she can give you better directions than I can   And when Gerda had been warmed up and had something to eat and drink  the Lapp woman wrote a few words on some split cod  told Gerda to take good care of it  bound her to the reindeer once more and off it leapt  ~newline~ whoosh   it said up in the sky  all night long the loveliest blue northern lights gleamed    and then they came to Finnmark and knocked on the chimney of the Finnmark woman  for she didn t even have a door  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~    First the reindeer told its story  then little Gerda s  and the Finnmark woman blinked her wise eyes  but didn t say anything  ~newline~ Won t you give the little girl a potion  so she can have the strength of twelve men and overpower the Snow Queen    The strength of twelve men   the Finnmark woman said   yes  that should do the trick   and she went over to a shelf  took out a large rolled up hide and unrolled it  on it strange letters were written  and the Finnmark woman read away till the sweat poured down her forehead  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ Then they carried Kay and Gerda first to the Finnmark woman  where they warmed themselves in her hot living room and were given directions for their home journey  then on to the Lapp woman  who had sewn new clothes for them and got her sleigh ready  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman 
36,The Snow Queen,small,Their parents lived close to each other  they lived in two attics  where the roof from one next door house met that of the other and the gutter followed the eaves  a small window faced outwards from each house  you only needed to step over the gutter to get from the one window to the other  ~newline~   Outside the windows both their parents had a large wooden box where they grew the vegetables they needed as well as a small rose tree   there was one in each box and they grew there so beautifully  ~newline~ Since the boxes were very high  and the children knew that they were not allowed to clamber up onto them  they were often both allowed to climb out to each other and sit on their small stools under the roses  and there they played so marvellously together  ~newline~ The windows were often completely frozen shut  but they would heat small copper coins on the tiled stove  place a hot coin on the frozen windowpane and it would form so round  perfectly round a fine peephole  behind which a wonderfully mild eye would peer out  one from each window   that of the little boy and the little girl  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ The next day there was a clear frost    and then it began to thaw  the sun shone  everything turned green  the swallows built their nests  the windows were opened  and the small children sat once more in their tiny garden high up in the gutter above all the storeys of the houses  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ It went faster and faster into the next street  the person driving it looked backwards and nodded to Kay in a friendly way  almost as if they knew each other  each time Kay wanted to unfasten his small sledge  the person nodded once more  and Kay stayed where he was  they drove straight out of the city gate  ~newline~ The boys could only say that they had seen him tie his small sledge to a magnificent large sleigh that drove off into the street and out at the city gate  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~ here we are   The boat drifted with the current  little Gerda sat quite still in her stockinged feet  her small red shoes floated behind  but they couldn t reach the boat  it started to move faster  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~ Then she took Gerda by the hand  they went into the small house  and the old woman shut the door behind them  ~newline~ And while she was eating  the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb  and her hair curled and shone so beautifully round the small  friendly face that was so round and resembled a rose  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for in one hand he is holding a small bowl  in the other a clay pipe  he is blowing soapbubbles  the swing swings  and the soap bubbles fly out in lovely  changing colours  the last one is still hanging on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~ There was such a sweet scent  and the girls went off into the forest  the scent grew stronger   three coffins  in which the lovely girls lay down  glided out from the thicket out across the lake  glow worms flew round them  glimmering like small floating lights  ~newline~  Down into a small yard God s sun shone so warmly on the first day of spring  its rays slid down the neighbour s white wall  close by the first yellow flowers were growing   gleaming gold in the warm rays of the sun   old grandmother was outside in her chair  her granddaughter   the poor  lovely maid servant   came home on a short visit  she kissed her grandmother  ~newline~   Up in the small attic room  half dressed  a little dancer is standing  now she s standing on one leg  now on two  and kicks her heels at the whole world  she is merely an optical illusion  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~  He had a small knapsack on his back   the crow said  ~newline~ and here s a small piece of bread for you  she took it from the kitchen  where there s plenty of bread  and you must be hungry  ~newline~ She folded her small hands and thought   How good creatures humans and animals are   and then she closed her eyes and slept profoundly  ~newline~ All the dreams came flying in once more  and then they looked like God s angels  and they pulled a small sledge  and on it sat Kay and nodded   but all of this was merely dreaming  which is why it had all disappeared again when she woke up  ~newline~ The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet  she was invited to stay at the palace and have a pleasant time  but all she asked for was to have a small carriage with a horse in front and a pair of small boots  and then she would be off again into the great wide world to find Kay  ~newline~    Inside  the coach was lined with sugared pretzels  and there were various types of fruit and small spicy biscuits in the seats  ~newline~ it s gold   they shouted  rushed forwards  seized the horses  killed the small jockeys  the coachman and the servants and then pulled little Gerda out of the carriage  ~newline~  You re to sleep with me here along with all my small animals   the robber girl said  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~ He was dragging some sharp flat pieces of ice around with him  which he combined in all sorts of ways  for he wanted to make something out of them  it was just like when we have small slabs of wood and make figures out of them  which we call the Chinese Game  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her  ~newline~  The tame sweetheart is now a widow and goes around with a small piece of black wool round her leg  she complains so pitifully and it s nonsense  all of it  ~newline~ The roses from the gutter bloomed in at the open windows  and there were the small children s     chairs  and Kay and Gerda sat down on them and held each other s hands   they had forgotten like some heavy dream the cold empty magnificence of the Snow Queen s palace 
34,The Snow Queen,like,The loveliest landscapes looked like boiled spinach in it  and the best of people turned ugly or stood on their heads with no stomach  their faces became so distorted that they were unrecognisable  and if someone had a freckle  you could be sure that it spread out over both nose and mouth  ~newline~ Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ The parents came to place the boxes across the gutter so that they almost reached from one window to the other and they looked almost exactly like two embankments of flowers  ~newline~ The long pea stalks hung down over the edges of the boxes  and the rose trees grew long branches  wound themselves round the windows  bent towards each other  It was almost like a triumphal arch of greenery and flowers  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ She was very fine and beautiful  but made of ice  of blinding  twinkling ice  and yet she was alive  her eyes stared like two bright stars  although there was no calmness or rest in them  ~newline~ Soon his heart would be like a lump of ice  ~newline~ they really are such ugly roses   they look like the boxes they re standing in   and he gave the box a hard shove with his foot and broke off the two roses  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~ creep into my bear fur coat   and she placed him in the sleigh with her  wrapped the fur round him  it felt like sinking into a snowdrift  ~newline~ The next day she could play again with the flowers in the warm sunshine   and many days passed like this  ~newline~ There was such a sweet scent  and the girls went off into the forest  the scent grew stronger   three coffins  in which the lovely girls lay down  glided out from the thicket out across the lake  glow worms flew round them  glimmering like small floating lights  ~newline~ So she had all her ladies in waiting drummed together  and when they heard what she wanted  they were so pleased   I like this   they said   I was thinking something similar only the other day     Believe you me  every word I m telling you is the truth   the crow said  ~newline~ it was on the third day when a little fellow turned up  without horse or carriage  marching quite unperturbed right up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had lovely long hair  but apart from that poor clothes    That was Kay   Gerda shouted with joy  ~newline~ He was unperturbed and dashing  he hadn t come at all to propose  only to hear the princess s cleverness  which he liked  and she liked him in return    Oh yes  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ We will take the direct route  for we will not encounter anyone there    I think I can hear someone right behind us   Gerda said  and it swished past her  it was like shadows along the wall  horses with flowing manes and thin legs  hunting lads  gentlemen and ladies on horseback  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ All the dreams came flying in once more  and then they looked like God s angels  and they pulled a small sledge  and on it sat Kay and nodded   but all of this was merely dreaming  which is why it had all disappeared again when she woke up  ~newline~ And she was given both boots and a muff  she was so finely clothed  and when she wanted to set off  a new coach of pure gold was standing at the door  the arms of the prince and princess shone from it like a star  coachman  servants and postilions   for there were also postilions   sat dressed in golden crowns  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ They drove through the dark forest  but the coach shone like a torch  it dazzled the robbers  and that they couldn t stomach  ~newline~ Now your hands look just like those of my hideous mother   And Gerda cried with joy  ~newline~  I can t stand you blubbering like that   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she

snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ He was dragging some sharp flat pieces of ice around with him  which he combined in all sorts of ways  for he wanted to make something out of them  it was just like when we have small slabs of wood and make figures out of them  which we call the Chinese Game  ~newline~ Kay was also trying to make figures  the most ingenious of all  it was the ice game of reason  to his eyes  the figures were quite excellent and of the utmost importance   it was the speck of glass in his eye that made him see things like that  ~newline~ And Gerda kissed his cheeks  and they started to bloom  she kissed his eyes  and they shone like hers  she kissed his hands and feet  and he was strong and healthy  ~newline~ The roses from the gutter bloomed in at the open windows  and there were the small children s     chairs  and Kay and Gerda sat down on them and held each other s hands   they had forgotten like some heavy dream the cold empty magnificence of the Snow Queen s palace 
32,The Snow Queen,crow,They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~ Gerda had to take another rest  then a large crow hopped over the snow opposite where she sat  after sitting there for a long while  looking at her and waggling its head it said   Caw  ~newline~ The world  alone  Gerda understood perfectly well and was well aware how much meaning lay in it  and so she told the crow about herself and her entire life and asked it if it hadn t seen Kay  ~newline~ And the crow nodded very thoughtfully and say   Could well be  ~newline~ could well be    What  do you really think so   the little girl shouted and almost squeezed the crow to death  so fervently did she kiss it  ~newline~    Steady now  steady now   the crow said  ~newline~  Yes  listen   the crow said   but it s hard for me to talk your language  ~newline~ If you understand crow language  I can tell you better    No  I ve not learnt it   Gerda said   but grandmother knew it  and she knew P language too  ~newline~ If only I had learnt it    No matter   the crow said   I ll tell you as best I can  but it won t be all that good even so   and then he told her what he knew  ~newline~ So she had all her ladies in waiting drummed together  and when they heard what she wanted  they were so pleased   I like this   they said   I was thinking something similar only the other day     Believe you me  every word I m telling you is the truth   the crow said  ~newline~  I have a tame sweetheart who is free to walk around the palace  and she s told me everything   His sweetheart was a crow too  of course  for birds of a feather flock together  which in this case always means a crow  ~newline~   Yes  yes   the crow said   believe you me  it is certain as I m sitting here  people flocked to the palace  there was such a hustle and bustle  but there was no success on either the first or the second day  ~newline~ I was in there to have a look myself   the crow said  ~newline~  He had a small knapsack on his back   the crow said  ~newline~  No  that must have been his sledge   Gerda said   for he had a sledge with him when he left       That may well be   the crow said   I didn t look all that closely  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~  And Kay won the princess even so then    If I hadn t been a crow  I d have taken her myself  despite the fact that I m engaged  ~newline~ He must have spoken as well as I m able to when I speak crow s language   I have it from my tame sweetheart  ~newline~   Oh  won t you take me in where the palace lies    Yes  that s easily said   the crow replied  ~newline~  When Kay hears that I am here  he will come out immediately and fetch me    Wait for me at the stile over there   the crow said  waggled its head and flew off  ~newline~ The crow didn t return until darkness had fallen   Rah  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~ Now they were on the staircase  a little lamp was burning on a cupboard  in the middle of the floor stood the tame crow and it turned its head in all directions and observed Gerda  who curtseyed  as her grandmother had taught her  ~newline~     My fianc  has said such nice things about you  little miss   the tame crow said   your Vita  as it is called  is also extremely moving  ~newline~  It s only dreams   the crow said   they ve come to fetch the thoughts of the royal household out hunting  a good thing as you can then more easily observe them in bed  ~newline~ But let me see  if you gain glory and honour  that you then display a grateful heart    That s nothing to talk about   said the crow from the forest  ~newline~ Then little Gerda cried and told them her entire story and everything that the crows had done for her  ~newline~  You poor little thing   the prince and princess said  and they praised the crows and said they weren t the slightest bit angry with them  but they shouldn t make a habit of it  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ And she was given both boots and a muff  she was so finely clothed  and when she wanted to set off  a new coach of pure gold was standing at the door  the arms of the prince and princess shone from it like a star  coachman  servants and postilions   for there were also postilions   sat dressed in golden crowns  ~newline~ The forest crow  which had now got married  accompanied them the first twenty miles or so  it sat next to her  for it couldn t travel backwards  the other crow stood at the gate and flapped its wings  it didn t accompany them  for it had a headache  since it now had a permanent position and had eaten too much  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ Now the coach came to a stop  there in the middle of the courtyard of a robber s castle  there were great cracks in it from top to bottom  ravens and crows flew out of the open holes  and the huge fierce dogs  each of which looked as if it could swallow a whole human being  leapt high into the air  but they didn t bark  for that was forbidden  ~newline~  But the crow   little Gerda asked  ~newline~  Well  the crow s dead   she answered

even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~  They are white bees that are swarming   the old grandmother said  ~newline~  Just let her try and come in  the boy said   and I ll put her on the hot stove  and then she ll melt   But the grandmother smoothed his hair and told them other stories  ~newline~ When she later came with the picture book  he said that it was only for babies  and if the grandmother told them stories  he always came up with some objection   and if he could  he would follow after her  put a pair of glasses on and speak exactly the way she did   so convincingly that it made people laugh at him  ~newline~ On the square the boldest boys often fastened their sledges to the farmer s cart and were pulled a really long way  ~newline~  Are you still freezing cold   she asked  and then kissed him on the forehead  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~  I ll put on my new  red shoes   she said one morning   Kay s never seen them  and I ll go down to the river and ask it     And it was quite early  she kissed the old grandmother  who was asleep  put on the red shoes and went all on her own out of the city gate to the river  ~newline~ It was beautiful on both the shores   lovely flowers  old trees and slopes with sheep and cows  but not a single person in sight  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~ Gerda called out even louder  and then and old  old woman came out of the house  leaning on a stick curved at one end  she was wearing a large sun bonnet  and on it the loveliest of flowers had been painted  ~newline~  You poor little child   the old woman said   how on earth have you ended up on the swift flowing river  carried far out into the great  wide world   and the old woman went right out into the water  caught hold of the boat with the curved end of her stick  pulled it ashore and lifted little Gerda out  ~newline~ And Gerda was glad to get back onto dry land  though a bit afraid of the strange  old woman  ~newline~ And Gerda told her everything  and the old woman shook her head and said  Hm  ~newline~ Then she took Gerda by the hand  they went into the small house  and the old woman shut the door behind them  ~newline~ And while she was eating  the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb  and her hair curled and shone so beautifully round the small  friendly face that was so round and resembled a rose  ~newline~    I ve so longed to have such a sweet little girl   the old woman said  ~newline~  Now you shall see how well the two of us are going to get on with each other   and while she combed little Gerda s hair  Gerda forgot more and more her playmate Kay  for the old woman was a sorceress  but not an evil one  she only did magic for her own pleasure  and now she wanted to keep little Gerda  ~newline~ The old woman was afraid that when Gerda saw the roses  she would think of her own and then remember little Kay and run away  ~newline~ Then one day she was sitting looking at the old woman s sun bonnet with the flowers painted on it  and the most beautiful of them all happened to be a rose  ~newline~ The old woman had forgotten to take it off her bonnet when she spirited all the others down into the ground  ~newline~    Out over the narrow mountain road hangs an old baronial castle  dense periwinkles grow up round its old red walls  leaf by leaf  up around the balcony where a lovely girl stands  she leans out over the balustrade and gazes down the road  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for in one hand he is holding a small bowl  in the other a clay pipe  he is blowing soapbubbles  the swing swings  and the soap bubbles fly out in lovely  changing colours  the last one is still hanging on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~  Down into a small yard God s sun shone so warmly on the first day of spring  its rays slid down the neighbour s white wall  close by the first yellow flowers were growing   gleaming gold in the warm rays of the sun   old grandmother was outside in her chair  her granddaughter   the poor  lovely maid servant   came home on a short visit  she kissed her grandmother  ~newline~ It was gold  the heart s gold  in that    delightful kiss  ~newline~ Lips touched with gold  heart made of gold  gold on high ere the day is old  ~newline~  My poor old grandmother   Gerda sighed  ~newline~ She pours water from the teapot onto a piece of clothing she is holding  it is her bodice    cleanliness is next to godliness  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~ The world  alone  Gerda understood perfectly well and was well aware how much meaning lay in it  and so she told the crow about herself and her entire life and asked it if it hadn t seen Kay  ~newline~ If only I had learnt it    No matter   the crow said   I ll tell you as best I can  but it won t be all that good even so   and then he told her what he knew  ~newline~  I have a tame sweetheart who is free to walk around the palace  and she s told me everything   His sweetheart was a crow too  of course  for birds of a feather flock together  which in this case always means a crow  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ but I know from my tame sweetheart that when he came in at the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all in silver and on the staircase the footmen all in gold  he wasn t the slightest bit overawed  he nodded and said to them   It must be boring standing on the stairs  I think I d rather go inside   There he came to halls glittering with light  privy councillors and excellencies walked around on their bare feet and carried gold dishes   the more ceremony the better  ~newline~   It s not possible for you to get inside the palace  for you are barefoot  the lifeguards in silver and footmen in gold wouldn t allow it  but don t cry  we ll get you up there even so  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~  It s only dreams   the crow said   they ve come to fetch the thoughts of the royal household out hunting  a good thing as you can then more easily observe them in bed  ~newline~ They now entered the first hall  it was of rose pink satin with imitation flowers up the walls  here the dreams already shot past them  but at such a pace that Gerda did not catch a glimpse of the royal household  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~ Then little Gerda cried and told them her entire story and everything that the crows had done for her  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ She folded her small hands and thought   How good creatures humans and animals are   and then she closed her eyes and slept profoundly  ~newline~ And she was given both boots and a muff  she was so finely clothed  and when she wanted to set off  a new coach of pure gold was standing at the door  the arms of the prince and princess shone from it like a star  coachman  servants and postilions   for there were also postilions   sat dressed in golden crowns  ~newline~  It s gold  ~newline~ it s gold   they shouted  rushed forwards  seized the horses  killed the small jockeys  the coachman and the servants and then pulled little Gerda out of the carriage  ~newline~  She s plump  she s fine  she s fattened with nut kernels   said the old robber woman  who had a long  wiry whiskers and eyebrows that hung down over her eyes  ~newline~  Ow   the old woman suddenly cried out  she had been bitten in the ear by her own little daughter  who hung on her back and was so wild and unkempt it was a joy to see  ~newline~ Are you really a princess    No   little Gerda said and told her everything she had experienced  and how fond she was of little Kay  ~newline~ In the large  old  sooty hall a large fire was burning in the middle of the stone floor  the smoke gathered up under the roof and had to find its own way out  a large cauldron of soup was stewing  and both hares and rabbits were being turned on a spit  ~newline~ they ll fly off at once if one doesn t have them securely behind bars  and here s my dear old Pooh   and she pulled out by the antlers a reindeer that had a shiny copper ring round its neck and was bound  ~newline~ But say again what you told me about little Kay  and why you set out into the great wide world   And Gerda told her from the beginning  and the pigeons cooed up there in their cage   the other pigeons slept  ~newline~ The robbers were sitting round the fire  singing and drinking  and the old robber woman was doing somersaults  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ You ve heard what she told me  for she spoke loudly enough and you were eavesdropping   The reindeer leapt into the air with joy  ~newline~  It s all the same   she said   here are your furry boots  for it will be cold  but I ll keep the muff myself  it s too delightful  ~newline~  Those are my old northern lights   the reindeer said   just look at how they gleam   and it shot off even faster  night and day  the loaves were eaten  the ham too and then they were in Lapland  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~ I ll write a few words on some split cod  I haven t any paper  I ll give it to you for the Finnmark woman up there  she can give you better directions than I can   And when Gerda had been warmed up and had something to eat and drink  the Lapp woman wrote a few words on some split cod  told Gerda to take good care of it  bound her to the reindeer once more and off it leapt  ~newline~    First the reindeer told its story  then little Gerda s  and the Finnmark woman blinked her wise eyes  but didn t say anything  ~newline~ She must not be told of her power by us  it resides in her heart  it exists because she is a sweet innocent child  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ There stood poor Gerda  without any shoes  without any mittens  in the middle of the frightful cold of Finnmark  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ The angels patted her feet and hands  so she should feel less how cold they were  and walked briskly on towards the Snow Queen s palace  ~newline~ The walls of the palace were of whirling snow and its windows and doors of biting winds  there were more than a hundred halls  formed as the snow drifted  the largest stretching many miles  all of them lit by the brightest northern lights  and they were so large  so empty  so icy cold and so gleaming  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~ Little Kay was quite blue with cold  yes  almost black  but he didn t notice it even so  for   remember   she had kissed the shiver of cold off him  and his heart was practically a lump of ice  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~  How cold it is here  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her  ~newline~   But tell me how things have gone for you  and how you managed to get hold of him   And both Gerda and Kay told her  ~newline~ The roses from the gutter bloomed in at the open windows  and there were the small children s     chairs  and Kay and Gerda sat down on them and held each other s hands   they had forgotten like some heavy dream the cold empty magnificence of the Snow Queen s palace  ~newline~ Grandmother was sitting in God s bright sunshine and was reading out loud from the Bible   Unless you become as little children  you will not enter the kingdom of Heaven   And Kay and Gerda looked into each other s eyes  and suddenly they understood the old hymn  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail 
31,The Snow Queen,looked,One day he was in a really good mood  for he had made a mirror that had the property of reducing everything good and beautiful that was reflected in it into practically nothing  but whatever was fit for nothing and looked bad grew more pronounced and became even worse  ~newline~ The loveliest landscapes looked like boiled spinach in it  and the best of people turned ugly or stood on their heads with no stomach  their faces became so distorted that they were unrecognisable  and if someone had a freckle  you could be sure that it spread out over both nose and mouth  ~newline~ Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ The parents came to place the boxes across the gutter so that they almost reached from one window to the other and they looked almost exactly like two embankments of flowers  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~ It went faster and faster into the next street  the person driving it looked backwards and nodded to Kay in a friendly way  almost as if they knew each other  each time Kay wanted to unfasten his small sledge  the person nodded once more  and Kay stayed where he was  they drove straight out of the city gate  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~  Tell me if you know where I can find my playmate   And the buttercup shone so beautifully and looked at Gerda once more  ~newline~   Asking the flowers isn t any help  all they know is their own song  they can t tell me anything   And so she tied up her little skirt  so that she could run faster  but the narcissus struck her over the leg as she jumped over it  then she stopped up  looked at the tall yellow flower and asked   Do you know something  perhaps   and bent down to it  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~ And the princess looked out from the white lily bed and asked what was happening  ~newline~ All the dreams came flying in once more  and then they looked like God s angels  and they pulled a small sledge  and on it sat Kay and nodded   but all of this was merely dreaming  which is why it had all disappeared again when she woke up  ~newline~ The little robber girl was as big as Gerda  but stronger  more broadshouldered and dark skinned  her eyes were quite black  so they almost looked sad  ~newline~ The robber girl looked at her very seriously  nodded slightly and said   They are not going to kill you  and if I nevertheless should happen to get angry with you  I d rather do it myself   and then she dried Gerda s eyes and stuffed both her hands in the lovely muff  which was so soft and so warm  ~newline~ Now the coach came to a stop  there in the middle of the courtyard of a robber s castle  there were great cracks in it from top to bottom  ravens and crows flew out of the open holes  and the huge fierce dogs  each of which looked as if it could swallow a whole human being  leapt high into the air  but they didn t bark  for that was forbidden  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ that s all part of it  it s good on top of lemons and grapes   and off flew the Snow Queen  and Kay sat all on his own in the many mile long empty ice hall and looked at the pieces of ice and racked his brains till they creaked  he sat there stiff and still  he looked as if he had frozen to death  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ And where have I been   And he looked around him  ~newline~ Grandmother was sitting in God s bright sunshine and was reading out loud from the Bible   Unless you become as little children  you will not enter the kingdom of Heaven   And Kay and Gerda looked into each other s eyes  and suddenly they understood the old hymn  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail 
30,The Snow Queen,large,Some pieces of the mirror were so large that they were used for window panes  but it wasn t worth looking at one s friends through that pane  others were put in spectacles  and things went badly when people put on those glasses so as to see clearly and be just  the evil ogre laughed till his stomach burst  and that tickled him so wonderfully  ~newline~   Outside the windows both their parents had a large wooden box where they grew the vegetables they needed as well as a small rose tree   there was one in each box and they grew there so beautifully  ~newline~ she is the largest of them all  and she never remains still on the ground  she keeps on flying up into the black cloud  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ The little boy took fright and jumped down from the chair  it was as if a large bird flew past the window  ~newline~ For it was one of the specks of glass that came from the mirror  the magic mirror   remember   the horrid glass that made everything large and good that was reflected in it become tiny and horrible  but what was evil and nasty became more obvious  and everything wrong with something was immediately noticeable  ~newline~ The games he played were so different from before   they were so dictated by reason    One winter s day  when the snowflakes came swirling down  he came with a large burning glass  held out the corner of his blue coat and let the snowflakes fall on it  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~ The boys could only say that they had seen him tie his small sledge to a magnificent large sleigh that drove off into the street and out at the city gate  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~ Gerda called out even louder  and then and old  old woman came out of the house  leaning on a stick curved at one end  she was wearing a large sun bonnet  and on it the loveliest of flowers had been painted  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ Gerda had to take another rest  then a large crow hopped over the snow opposite where she sat  after sitting there for a long while  looking at her and waggling its head it said   Caw  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~ In the large  old  sooty hall a large fire was burning in the middle of the stone floor  the smoke gathered up under the roof and had to find its own way out  a large cauldron of soup was stewing  and both hares and rabbits were being turned on a spit  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~ Won t you give the little girl a potion  so she can have the strength of twelve men and overpower the Snow Queen    The strength of twelve men   the Finnmark woman said   yes  that should do the trick   and she went over to a shelf  took out a large rolled up hide and unrolled it  on it strange letters were written  and the Finnmark woman read away till the sweat poured down her forehead  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they

that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ And they took each other by the hand and walked out of the large palace  they talked about grandmother and about the roses up on the roof  and wherever they walked  the winds died down and sun came out  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  the reindeer was standing there waiting for them  it had another young reindeer with it with a full udder  and it gave the young ones its warm milk and kissed them on the lips 
29,The Snow Queen,queen, Do they also have a bee queen   the little boy asked  for he knew that among real bees there is such a queen  ~newline~ Gerda jumped for joy  and played until the sun set behind the tall cherry trees  then she was given a lovely bed with red silk duvets that were filled with blue violets  and she slept and dreamt in it as sweetly as any queen on her wedding day  ~newline~ there the snow queen has her summer tent  but her permanent palace is up near the North Pole  on the island they call Spitsbergen    Oh Kay  little Kay   Gerda sighed 
28,The Snow Queen,came,One day he was in a really good mood  for he had made a mirror that had the property of reducing everything good and beautiful that was reflected in it into practically nothing  but whatever was fit for nothing and looked bad grew more pronounced and became even worse  ~newline~ The loveliest landscapes looked like boiled spinach in it  and the best of people turned ugly or stood on their heads with no stomach  their faces became so distorted that they were unrecognisable  and if someone had a freckle  you could be sure that it spread out over both nose and mouth  ~newline~ The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ The parents came to place the boxes across the gutter so that they almost reached from one window to the other and they looked almost exactly like two embankments of flowers  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ For it was one of the specks of glass that came from the mirror  the magic mirror   remember   the horrid glass that made everything large and good that was reflected in it become tiny and horrible  but what was evil and nasty became more obvious  and everything wrong with something was immediately noticeable  ~newline~ When she later came with the picture book  he said that it was only for babies  and if the grandmother told them stories  he always came up with some objection   and if he could  he would follow after her  put a pair of glasses on and speak exactly the way she did   so convincingly that it made people laugh at him  ~newline~ The games he played were so different from before   they were so dictated by reason    One winter s day  when the snowflakes came swirling down  he came with a large burning glass  held out the corner of his blue coat and let the snowflakes fall on it  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~ and there isn t a single fault in them anywhere  they are perfectly accurate   as long as they don t melt   Shortly afterwards  Kay came along with big gloves and his sledge on his back  he shouted right into Gerda s ear   I ve been given permission to go sledging on the great square where the others play   and off he rushed  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~ The flower garden of the woman who knew the art of sorcery But how were things with little Gerda  now that Kay no longer came  ~newline~ Then spring came and the sun grew warmer  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~ Gerda called out to them  she thought they were alive  but they didn t answer of course  she came quite close to them  the current brought the boat straight in towards the land  ~newline~ Gerda called out even louder  and then and old  old woman came out of the house  leaning on a stick curved at one end  she was wearing a large sun bonnet  and on it the loveliest of flowers had been painted  ~newline~  Down into a small yard God s sun shone so warmly on the first day of spring  its rays slid down the neighbour s white wall  close by the first yellow flowers were growing   gleaming gold in the warm rays of the sun   old grandmother was outside in her chair  her granddaughter   the poor  lovely maid servant   came home on a short visit  she kissed her grandmother  ~newline~ The door was shut  but she wriggled the rusty hasp till it came loose  and the door sprung open  and then little Gerda ran off on her bare feet into the great wide world  ~newline~  The newspapers immediately came out edged with hearts and the princess s monogram  there people could read that any young man who was handsome was free to come up to the palace and speak with the princess  and the one who spoke in such a way that one could hear he belonged there  and who spoke best  the princess would take as her husband  ~newline~ but I know from my tame sweetheart that when he came in at the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all in silver and on the staircase the footmen all in gold  he wasn t the slightest bit overawed  he nodded and said to them   It must be boring standing on the stairs  I think I d rather go inside   There he came to halls glittering with light  privy councillors and excellencies walked around on their bare feet and carried gold dishes   the more ceremony the better  ~newline~ All the dreams came flying in once more  and then they looked like God s angels  and they pulled a small sledge  and on it sat Kay and nodded   but all of this was merely dreaming  which is why it had all disappeared again when she woke up  ~newline~ Now the coach came to a stop  there in the middle of the courtyard of a robber s castle  there were great cracks in it from top to bottom  ravens and crows flew out of the open holes  and the huge fierce dogs  each of which looked as if it could swallow a whole human being  leapt high into the air  but they didn t bark  for that was forbidden  ~newline~ Above them      on lathes and perches  sat almost a hundred pigeons  all of which seemed to be asleep  although they turned slightly when the young girls came  ~newline~ whoosh   it said up in the sky  all night long the loveliest blue northern lights gleamed    and then they came to Finnmark and knocked on the chimney of the Finnmark woman  for she didn t even have a door  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ And they took each other by the hand and walked out of the large palace  they talked about grandmother and about the roses up on the roof  and wherever they walked  the winds died down and sun came out  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  the reindeer was standing there waiting for them  it had another young reindeer with it with a full udder  and it gave the young ones its warm milk and kissed them on the lips  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her 
25,The Snow Queen,reindeer,they ll fly off at once if one doesn t have them securely behind bars  and here s my dear old Pooh   and she pulled out by the antlers a reindeer that had a shiny copper ring round its neck and was bound  ~newline~ Every single evening I tickle his throat with my sharp knife   he s so afraid of that   and the little girl pulled a long knife out of a cleft in the wall and let it glide over the reindeer s neck  the poor animal kicked out with its legs  and the robber girl laughed and pulled down Gerda with her onto the bed  ~newline~ just ask the reindeer who s bound on the rope    There s ice and snow there  it s wonderful and marvellous there   the reindeer said   there you can run around freely in the vast gleaming valleys  ~newline~   Do you know where Lapland is   she asked the reindeer  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~ You ve heard what she told me  for she spoke loudly enough and you were eavesdropping   The reindeer leapt into the air with joy  ~newline~ and here are two loaves and a ham for you  so you won t go hungry   Both were fixed behind her on the reindeer  the little robber girl opened the door  enticed all the big dogs inside  and then she cut through the rope and said to the reindeer   Off you run  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~  Those are my old northern lights   the reindeer said   just look at how they gleam   and it shot off even faster  night and day  the loaves were eaten  the ham too and then they were in Lapland  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~ I ll write a few words on some split cod  I haven t any paper  I ll give it to you for the Finnmark woman up there  she can give you better directions than I can   And when Gerda had been warmed up and had something to eat and drink  the Lapp woman wrote a few words on some split cod  told Gerda to take good care of it  bound her to the reindeer once more and off it leapt  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~    First the reindeer told its story  then little Gerda s  and the Finnmark woman blinked her wise eyes  but didn t say anything  ~newline~  You are so wise   the reindeer said   I know you can tie up all the winds in the world on a piece of sewing thread  if the skipper undoes the one knot  he gets a fair wind  if he undoes the other  it blows hard  and if he undoes the third and fourth  there is such a gale that the forests blow down  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ And they took each other by the hand and walked out of the large palace  they talked about grandmother and about the roses up on the roof  and wherever they walked  the winds died down and sun came out  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  the reindeer was standing there waiting for them  it had another young reindeer with it with a full udder  and it gave the young ones its warm milk and kissed them on the lips  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman 
25,The Snow Queen,robber,The little robber girl  ~newline~ They drove through the dark forest  but the coach shone like a torch  it dazzled the robbers  and that they couldn t stomach  ~newline~  She s plump  she s fine  she s fattened with nut kernels   said the old robber woman  who had a long  wiry whiskers and eyebrows that hung down over her eyes  ~newline~  She s to play with me   the little robber girl said  ~newline~  She s to give me her muff  her beautiful dress  sleep with me in my bed   and she bit her mother again  so the robber woman leapt into the air and turned round  and all the robbers laughed and said   See  how she dances with her young brat    I want to go inside the coach   the little robber girl said and simply had to have her will  for she was so spoilt and so stubborn  ~newline~ The little robber girl was as big as Gerda  but stronger  more broadshouldered and dark skinned  her eyes were quite black  so they almost looked sad  ~newline~ The robber girl looked at her very seriously  nodded slightly and said   They are not going to kill you  and if I nevertheless should happen to get angry with you  I d rather do it myself   and then she dried Gerda s eyes and stuffed both her hands in the lovely muff  which was so soft and so warm  ~newline~ Now the coach came to a stop  there in the middle of the courtyard of a robber s castle  there were great cracks in it from top to bottom  ravens and crows flew out of the open holes  and the huge fierce dogs  each of which looked as if it could swallow a whole human being  leapt high into the air  but they didn t bark  for that was forbidden  ~newline~  You re to sleep with me here along with all my small animals   the robber girl said  ~newline~  They are all mine   the little robber girl said and swiftly grabbed one of those closest  held it by its legs and shook it  so that it flapped its wings  ~newline~ Every single evening I tickle his throat with my sharp knife   he s so afraid of that   and the little girl pulled a long knife out of a cleft in the wall and let it glide over the reindeer s neck  the poor animal kicked out with its legs  and the robber girl laughed and pulled down Gerda with her onto the bed  ~newline~  I always sleep with a knife   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ The little robber girl placed her arm round Gerda s neck  held the knife in the other hand and fell noisily asleep  but Gerda simply couldn t close her eyes  she didn t know if she was going to live or die  ~newline~ The robbers were sitting round the fire  singing and drinking  and the old robber woman was doing somersaults  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~ The robber girl lifted little Gerda up and took the precaution of binding her  even of giving her a cushion to sit on  ~newline~  I can t stand you blubbering like that   the little robber girl said  ~newline~ and here are two loaves and a ham for you  so you won t go hungry   Both were fixed behind her on the reindeer  the little robber girl opened the door  enticed all the big dogs inside  and then she cut through the rope and said to the reindeer   Off you run  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her  ~newline~  They ve left for abroad   the robber girl said  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
24,The Snow Queen,long,The long pea stalks hung down over the edges of the boxes  and the rose trees grew long branches  wound themselves round the windows  bent towards each other  It was almost like a triumphal arch of greenery and flowers  ~newline~ It no longer hurt  but it was still there  ~newline~ and there isn t a single fault in them anywhere  they are perfectly accurate   as long as they don t melt   Shortly afterwards  Kay came along with big gloves and his sledge on his back  he shouted right into Gerda s ear   I ve been given permission to go sledging on the great square where the others play   and off he rushed  ~newline~ On the square the boldest boys often fastened their sledges to the farmer s cart and were pulled a really long way  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ Then the snow started to fall so thick and fast that the little boy couldn t see a hand in front of his face  while he hurtled along   then he quickly let go of the string to free    himself from the big sleigh  but that didn t help him a bit  his little sledge was still attached and he was travelling as fast as the wind  ~newline~ Then he shouted very loudly  but no one heard him  and the snow whirled past and the sledge flew along  from time to time it gave a leap   it was as if he was travelling over ditches and fences  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~ The flower garden of the woman who knew the art of sorcery But how were things with little Gerda  now that Kay no longer came  ~newline~ No one knew where he was  many tears were shed  little Gerda wept profoundly and a long time    then they said that he was dead  had drowned in the river that ran close to the city  oh  these were drawn out  dismal winter days  ~newline~ Then little Gerda felt quite scared and started to cry  but no one heard her except the house sparrows  and they could not carry her back to the shore  but they flew alongside it and sang  as if to comfort her   Here we are  ~newline~    I ve so longed to have such a sweet little girl   the old woman said  ~newline~  Oh  how long I ve been delayed   the little girl said  ~newline~   In her long  red sari the Hindu wife stands on the pyre  the flames rise up around her and her dead husband  but the Hindu woman thinks of the living one here in the circle  of him whose eyes burn more fiercely than the flames  of him whose eyes  fire reach her heart more than the flames that soon will turn her body into ashes  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for in one hand he is holding a small bowl  in the other a clay pipe  he is blowing soapbubbles  the swing swings  and the soap bubbles fly out in lovely  changing colours  the last one is still hanging on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~  Yes  she s sure to be longing for me  worried about me as she was for little Kay  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~ Gerda had to take another rest  then a large crow hopped over the snow opposite where she sat  after sitting there for a long while  looking at her and waggling its head it said   Caw  ~newline~  The newspapers immediately came out edged with hearts and the princess s monogram  there people could read that any young man who was handsome was free to come up to the palace and speak with the princess  and the one who spoke in such a way that one could hear he belonged there  and who spoke best  the princess would take as her husband  ~newline~ There was a long line right from the city gate to the palace  ~newline~ it was on the third day when a little fellow turned up  without horse or carriage  marching quite unperturbed right up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had lovely long hair  but apart from that poor clothes    That was Kay   Gerda shouted with joy  ~newline~ Oh  how Gerda s heart pounded with fear and longing  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ He would of course be glad to see her  hear about the long way she had come for his sake  know how sorrowful everyone at home had been when he didn t return  ~newline~ We will take the direct route  for we will not encounter anyone there    I think I can hear someone right behind us   Gerda said  and it swished past her  it was like shadows along the wall  horses with flowing manes and thin legs  hunting lads  gentlemen and ladies on horseback  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~  She s plump  she s fine  she s fattened with nut kernels   said the old robber woman  who had a long  wiry whiskers and eyebrows that hung down over her eyes  ~newline~ She took Gerda by the waist and said   They re not going to kill you  as long as I don t get angry with you  ~newline~  You re to sleep with me here along with all my small animals   the robber girl said  ~newline~ Every single evening I tickle his throat with my sharp knife   he s so afraid of that   and the little girl pulled a long knife out of a cleft in the wall and let it glide over the reindeer s neck  the poor animal kicked out with its legs  and the robber girl laughed and pulled down Gerda with her onto the bed  ~newline~  Oh  you poor things   the Lapp woman said   in that case you still have a long way to go  ~newline~ whoosh   it said up in the sky  all night long the loveliest blue northern lights gleamed    and then they came to Finnmark and knocked on the chimney of the Finnmark woman  for she didn t even have a door  ~newline~ that s all part of it  it s good on top of lemons and grapes   and off flew the Snow Queen  and Kay sat all on his own in the many mile long empty ice hall and looked at the pieces of ice and racked his brains till they creaked  he sat there stiff and still  he looked as if he had frozen to death  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
23,The Snow Queen,sat,The next day there was a clear frost    and then it began to thaw  the sun shone  everything turned green  the swallows built their nests  the windows were opened  and the small children sat once more in their tiny garden high up in the gutter above all the storeys of the houses  ~newline~ It was when Kay and Gerda sat there looking at a picture book with animals and birds   the clock was just striking five on the great church steeple   that Kay said   Ow  something s stuck me in the heart  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ here we are   The boat drifted with the current  little Gerda sat quite still in her stockinged feet  her small red shoes floated behind  but they couldn t reach the boat  it started to move faster  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ Gerda had to take another rest  then a large crow hopped over the snow opposite where she sat  after sitting there for a long while  looking at her and waggling its head it said   Caw  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ They now entered the first hall  it was of rose pink satin with imitation flowers up the walls  here the dreams already shot past them  but at such a pace that Gerda did not catch a glimpse of the royal household  ~newline~ All the dreams came flying in once more  and then they looked like God s angels  and they pulled a small sledge  and on it sat Kay and nodded   but all of this was merely dreaming  which is why it had all disappeared again when she woke up  ~newline~ And she was given both boots and a muff  she was so finely clothed  and when she wanted to set off  a new coach of pure gold was standing at the door  the arms of the prince and princess shone from it like a star  coachman  servants and postilions   for there were also postilions   sat dressed in golden crowns  ~newline~ The forest crow  which had now got married  accompanied them the first twenty miles or so  it sat next to her  for it couldn t travel backwards  the other crow stood at the gate and flapped its wings  it didn t accompany them  for it had a headache  since it now had a permanent position and had eaten too much  ~newline~ She and Gerda sat down in it  and then they drove over tree stumps and thorn bushes deeper into the forest  ~newline~ Above them      on lathes and perches  sat almost a hundred pigeons  all of which seemed to be asleep  although they turned slightly when the young girls came  ~newline~ A white hen bore his sledge  he sat in the Snow Queen s carriage  which streaked down low above the forest where we lay in our nest  she blew on us young birds  and all of them died except the two of us two  coo  ~newline~ In the very middle of the empty endless snow hall there was a frozen lake  it had cracked into a thousand pieces  but each piece resembled the next one completely  so that it was nothing less than a feat  and in the middle of it the Snow Queen sat when at home  and then she said that she sat in the mirror of reason  and that this was the only and best thing in the world  ~newline~ that s all part of it  it s good on top of lemons and grapes   and off flew the Snow Queen  and Kay sat all on his own in the many mile long empty ice hall and looked at the pieces of ice and racked his brains till they creaked  he sat there stiff and still  he looked as if he had frozen to death  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ The roses from the gutter bloomed in at the open windows  and there were the small children s     chairs  and Kay and Gerda sat down on them and held each other s hands   they had forgotten like some heavy dream the cold empty magnificence of the Snow Queen s palace  ~newline~ There they sat  two grown ups and yet children  children at heart  and it was summer  warm  wonderful summer 
23,The Snow Queen,went,If a good pious thought went through the mind of a person  a grin appeared in the mirror  so that the ogre devil had to laugh at his ingenious invention  ~newline~ Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ Some pieces of the mirror were so large that they were used for window panes  but it wasn t worth looking at one s friends through that pane  others were put in spectacles  and things went badly when people put on those glasses so as to see clearly and be just  the evil ogre laughed till his stomach burst  and that tickled him so wonderfully  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ It went faster and faster into the next street  the person driving it looked backwards and nodded to Kay in a friendly way  almost as if they knew each other  each time Kay wanted to unfasten his small sledge  the person nodded once more  and Kay stayed where he was  they drove straight out of the city gate  ~newline~ He was quite frightened  wanted to say his Lord s Prayer  but all he could remember was his multiplication table from ten to twenty  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~  I ll put on my new  red shoes   she said one morning   Kay s never seen them  and I ll go down to the river and ask it     And it was quite early  she kissed the old grandmother  who was asleep  put on the red shoes and went all on her own out of the city gate to the river  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~  You poor little child   the old woman said   how on earth have you ended up on the swift flowing river  carried far out into the great  wide world   and the old woman went right out into the water  caught hold of the boat with the curved end of her stick  pulled it ashore and lifted little Gerda out  ~newline~ Then she took Gerda by the hand  they went into the small house  and the old woman shut the door behind them  ~newline~ That was why she went out into the garden  stretched her curved stick out towards all the rose trees  and  no matter how beautifully they were blooming  they all sank down into the black earth and no one could see where they had once stood  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~ There was such a sweet scent  and the girls went off into the forest  the scent grew stronger   three coffins  in which the lovely girls lay down  glided out from the thicket out across the lake  glow worms flew round them  glimmering like small floating lights  ~newline~ we are just singing our song  the only one we know   And Gerda went over to the buttercup  which could be seen gleaming among the shiny  green leaves  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~ The forest crow  which had now got married  accompanied them the first twenty miles or so  it sat next to her  for it couldn t travel backwards  the other crow stood at the gate and flapped its wings  it didn t accompany them  for it had a headache  since it now had a permanent position and had eaten too much  ~newline~ They were given food and drink and then they went over into a corner where straw and blankets lay  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~ They stopped at a tiny house  it was so pitiful  the roof went right down to the ground  and the door was so low that the family had to creep on their stomachs when they wanted to go in or out  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~ Won t you give the little girl a potion  so she can have the strength of twelve men and overpower the Snow Queen    The strength of twelve men   the Finnmark woman said   yes  that should do the trick   and she went over to a shelf  took out a large rolled up hide and unrolled it  on it strange letters were written  and the Finnmark woman read away till the sweat poured down her forehead  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
22,The Snow Queen,knew,Since the boxes were very high  and the children knew that they were not allowed to clamber up onto them  they were often both allowed to climb out to each other and sit on their small stools under the roses  and there they played so marvellously together  ~newline~  Do they also have a bee queen   the little boy asked  for he knew that among real bees there is such a queen  ~newline~ On many a winter night she flies through the city streets and looks in through the windows  and then they freeze over so strangely  as if with flowers    Yes  I ve seen that   both the children said  and so they knew it was true  ~newline~ It went faster and faster into the next street  the person driving it looked backwards and nodded to Kay in a friendly way  almost as if they knew each other  each time Kay wanted to unfasten his small sledge  the person nodded once more  and Kay stayed where he was  they drove straight out of the city gate  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ The flower garden of the woman who knew the art of sorcery But how were things with little Gerda  now that Kay no longer came  ~newline~   No one knew  no one had anything to tell  ~newline~ No one knew where he was  many tears were shed  little Gerda wept profoundly and a long time    then they said that he was dead  had drowned in the river that ran close to the city  oh  these were drawn out  dismal winter days  ~newline~ Gerda knew every kind of flower  but no matter how many there were  she felt that one was missing  but which one she was unable to say  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~ If you understand crow language  I can tell you better    No  I ve not learnt it   Gerda said   but grandmother knew it  and she knew P language too  ~newline~ If only I had learnt it    No matter   the crow said   I ll tell you as best I can  but it won t be all that good even so   and then he told her what he knew  ~newline~ The other day she s sitting on the throne  and that is not all that much fun  people say  when she happens to start humming a tune that is precisely this one   Why shouldn t I get married    Hey  that s not a bad idea   she says  and was so eager to get married  but she wanted to have a husband that knew how to answer back when talked to  one that didn t just stand there looking fine   for that s so boring  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ Then Kay burst into tears  he wept so hard that the speck from the mirror rolled out of his eyes  he knew her and cried out joyously   Gerda  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her  ~newline~ She knew Gerda immediately and Gerda knew her   and there was great happiness  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
22,The Snow Queen,see,Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ Some pieces of the mirror were so large that they were used for window panes  but it wasn t worth looking at one s friends through that pane  others were put in spectacles  and things went badly when people put on those glasses so as to see clearly and be just  the evil ogre laughed till his stomach burst  and that tickled him so wonderfully  ~newline~ On many a winter night she flies through the city streets and looks in through the windows  and then they freeze over so strangely  as if with flowers    Yes  I ve seen that   both the children said  and so they knew it was true  ~newline~ What delightful summer days they were  how wonderful it was to be out there with the fresh rose trees that never seemed as if they would stop blooming  ~newline~ and now I ve got something in my eye   The little girl held him by the neck  he blinked his eyes  no  there was nothing to be seen  ~newline~ Then the snow started to fall so thick and fast that the little boy couldn t see a hand in front of his face  while he hurtled along   then he quickly let go of the string to free    himself from the big sleigh  but that didn t help him a bit  his little sledge was still attached and he was travelling as fast as the wind  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ The boys could only say that they had seen him tie his small sledge to a magnificent large sleigh that drove off into the street and out at the city gate  ~newline~  I ll put on my new  red shoes   she said one morning   Kay s never seen them  and I ll go down to the river and ask it     And it was quite early  she kissed the old grandmother  who was asleep  put on the red shoes and went all on her own out of the city gate to the river  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~  Now you shall see how well the two of us are going to get on with each other   and while she combed little Gerda s hair  Gerda forgot more and more her playmate Kay  for the old woman was a sorceress  but not an evil one  she only did magic for her own pleasure  and now she wanted to keep little Gerda  ~newline~ That was why she went out into the garden  stretched her curved stick out towards all the rose trees  and  no matter how beautifully they were blooming  they all sank down into the black earth and no one could see where they had once stood  ~newline~ we are just singing our song  the only one we know   And Gerda went over to the buttercup  which could be seen gleaming among the shiny  green leaves  ~newline~  I can see myself  ~newline~ I can see myself   the narcissus said  ~newline~ see how she struts on one stem  ~newline~ I can see myself  ~newline~ I can see myself    I don t care about that   Gerda said  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~ The world  alone  Gerda understood perfectly well and was well aware how much meaning lay in it  and so she told the crow about herself and her entire life and asked it if it hadn t seen Kay  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ He would of course be glad to see her  hear about the long way she had come for his sake  know how sorrowful everyone at home had been when he didn t return  ~newline~ But let me see  if you gain glory and honour  that you then display a grateful heart    That s nothing to talk about   said the crow from the forest  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~  Ow   the old woman suddenly cried out  she had been bitten in the ear by her own little daughter  who hung on her back and was so wild and unkempt it was a joy to see  ~newline~ Above them      on lathes and perches  sat almost a hundred pigeons  all of which seemed to be asleep  although they turned slightly when the young girls came  ~newline~ we ve seen little Kay  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ can t you see how great that is  ~newline~ Can t you see how humans and animals have to serve her  how she has managed to get so far in the world on her own bare feet  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ Kay was also trying to make figures  the most ingenious of all  it was the ice game of reason  to his eyes  the figures were quite excellent and of the utmost importance   it was the speck of glass in his eye that made him see things like that  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman 
21,The Snow Queen,palace, I have a tame sweetheart who is free to walk around the palace  and she s told me everything   His sweetheart was a crow too  of course  for birds of a feather flock together  which in this case always means a crow  ~newline~  The newspapers immediately came out edged with hearts and the princess s monogram  there people could read that any young man who was handsome was free to come up to the palace and speak with the princess  and the one who spoke in such a way that one could hear he belonged there  and who spoke best  the princess would take as her husband  ~newline~   Yes  yes   the crow said   believe you me  it is certain as I m sitting here  people flocked to the palace  there was such a hustle and bustle  but there was no success on either the first or the second day  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ There was a long line right from the city gate to the palace  ~newline~  They grew both hungry and thirsty   but they didn t get so much as a glass of lukewarm water from the palace  ~newline~ it was on the third day when a little fellow turned up  without horse or carriage  marching quite unperturbed right up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had lovely long hair  but apart from that poor clothes    That was Kay   Gerda shouted with joy  ~newline~ but I know from my tame sweetheart that when he came in at the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all in silver and on the staircase the footmen all in gold  he wasn t the slightest bit overawed  he nodded and said to them   It must be boring standing on the stairs  I think I d rather go inside   There he came to halls glittering with light  privy councillors and excellencies walked around on their bare feet and carried gold dishes   the more ceremony the better  ~newline~   Oh  won t you take me in where the palace lies    Yes  that s easily said   the crow replied  ~newline~   It s not possible for you to get inside the palace  for you are barefoot  the lifeguards in silver and footmen in gold wouldn t allow it  but don t cry  we ll get you up there even so  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~ The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet  she was invited to stay at the palace and have a pleasant time  but all she asked for was to have a small carriage with a horse in front and a pair of small boots  and then she would be off again into the great wide world to find Kay  ~newline~ there the snow queen has her summer tent  but her permanent palace is up near the North Pole  on the island they call Spitsbergen    Oh Kay  little Kay   Gerda sighed  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~ The angels patted her feet and hands  so she should feel less how cold they were  and walked briskly on towards the Snow Queen s palace  ~newline~ It is true that wasn t thinking of little Gerda  least of all that she was standing outside the palace  ~newline~ What happened in the Snow Queen s palace  and what happened afterwards  ~newline~ The walls of the palace were of whirling snow and its windows and doors of biting winds  there were more than a hundred halls  formed as the snow drifted  the largest stretching many miles  all of them lit by the brightest northern lights  and they were so large  so empty  so icy cold and so gleaming  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ And they took each other by the hand and walked out of the large palace  they talked about grandmother and about the roses up on the roof  and wherever they walked  the winds died down and sun came out  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  the reindeer was standing there waiting for them  it had another young reindeer with it with a full udder  and it gave the young ones its warm milk and kissed them on the lips  ~newline~ The roses from the gutter bloomed in at the open windows  and there were the small children s     chairs  and Kay and Gerda sat down on them and held each other s hands   they had forgotten like some heavy dream the cold empty magnificence of the Snow Queen s palace 
21,The Snow Queen,princess,The prince and princess  ~newline~ but now he s probably forgotten you for the princess    Does he live with a princess   Gerda asked  ~newline~  In the kingdom we are now sitting in there lives a princess who is so immensely clever  but then she has also read all the newspapers that exist in the world  and forgotten them again   she is that clever  ~newline~  The newspapers immediately came out edged with hearts and the princess s monogram  there people could read that any young man who was handsome was free to come up to the palace and speak with the princess  and the one who spoke in such a way that one could hear he belonged there  and who spoke best  the princess would take as her husband  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ The wisest of them had admittedly taken some sandwiches with them  but they didn t share them with the man next to them  for they thought  Just let him look hungry  then the princess won t take him    But Kay  little Kay   Gerda asked  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~  And Kay won the princess even so then    If I hadn t been a crow  I d have taken her myself  despite the fact that I m engaged  ~newline~ He was unperturbed and dashing  he hadn t come at all to propose  only to hear the princess s cleverness  which he liked  and she liked him in return    Oh yes  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~ And the princess looked out from the white lily bed and asked what was happening  ~newline~  You poor little thing   the prince and princess said  and they praised the crows and said they weren t the slightest bit angry with them  but they shouldn t make a habit of it  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ And she was given both boots and a muff  she was so finely clothed  and when she wanted to set off  a new coach of pure gold was standing at the door  the arms of the prince and princess shone from it like a star  coachman  servants and postilions   for there were also postilions   sat dressed in golden crowns  ~newline~ The prince and princess helped her into the carriage themselves and wished her every success  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ Are you really a princess    No   little Gerda said and told her everything she had experienced  and how fond she was of little Kay  ~newline~  You re a fine fellow to go traipsing around   she said to little Kay   I wonder if you re worth running to the ends of the world for   But Gerda patted her on the cheek  and asked about the prince and princess 
21,The Snow Queen,eyes,The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ She was very fine and beautiful  but made of ice  of blinding  twinkling ice  and yet she was alive  her eyes stared like two bright stars  although there was no calmness or rest in them  ~newline~ and now I ve got something in my eye   The little girl held him by the neck  he blinked his eyes  no  there was nothing to be seen  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~   In her long  red sari the Hindu wife stands on the pyre  the flames rise up around her and her dead husband  but the Hindu woman thinks of the living one here in the circle  of him whose eyes burn more fiercely than the flames  of him whose eyes  fire reach her heart more than the flames that soon will turn her body into ashes  ~newline~ it was on the third day when a little fellow turned up  without horse or carriage  marching quite unperturbed right up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had lovely long hair  but apart from that poor clothes    That was Kay   Gerda shouted with joy  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ She folded her small hands and thought   How good creatures humans and animals are   and then she closed her eyes and slept profoundly  ~newline~  She s plump  she s fine  she s fattened with nut kernels   said the old robber woman  who had a long  wiry whiskers and eyebrows that hung down over her eyes  ~newline~ The little robber girl was as big as Gerda  but stronger  more broadshouldered and dark skinned  her eyes were quite black  so they almost looked sad  ~newline~ The robber girl looked at her very seriously  nodded slightly and said   They are not going to kill you  and if I nevertheless should happen to get angry with you  I d rather do it myself   and then she dried Gerda s eyes and stuffed both her hands in the lovely muff  which was so soft and so warm  ~newline~ The little robber girl placed her arm round Gerda s neck  held the knife in the other hand and fell noisily asleep  but Gerda simply couldn t close her eyes  she didn t know if she was going to live or die  ~newline~  Who could know better than I can   the animal said  and its eyes rolled in its head  ~newline~    First the reindeer told its story  then little Gerda s  and the Finnmark woman blinked her wise eyes  but didn t say anything  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ Kay was also trying to make figures  the most ingenious of all  it was the ice game of reason  to his eyes  the figures were quite excellent and of the utmost importance   it was the speck of glass in his eye that made him see things like that  ~newline~ Then Kay burst into tears  he wept so hard that the speck from the mirror rolled out of his eyes  he knew her and cried out joyously   Gerda  ~newline~ And Gerda kissed his cheeks  and they started to bloom  she kissed his eyes  and they shone like hers  she kissed his hands and feet  and he was strong and healthy  ~newline~ Grandmother was sitting in God s bright sunshine and was reading out loud from the Bible   Unless you become as little children  you will not enter the kingdom of Heaven   And Kay and Gerda looked into each other s eyes  and suddenly they understood the old hymn  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail 
20,The Snow Queen,asked, Do they also have a bee queen   the little boy asked  for he knew that among real bees there is such a queen  ~newline~  Can the Snow Queen come in here   the little girl asked  ~newline~  What are you crying for   he asked  It makes you look ugly  ~newline~  Are you still freezing cold   she asked  and then kissed him on the forehead  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~   Don t you know where he is   she asked the roses  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~  Isn t he on his way yet     Do you mean Kay   little Gerda asked  ~newline~   Asking the flowers isn t any help  all they know is their own song  they can t tell me anything   And so she tied up her little skirt  so that she could run faster  but the narcissus struck her over the leg as she jumped over it  then she stopped up  looked at the tall yellow flower and asked   Do you know something  perhaps   and bent down to it  ~newline~ goodday   That was the best it could manage  but it was so well meaning with the little girl and it asked her where she was heading alone in the great wide world  ~newline~ The world  alone  Gerda understood perfectly well and was well aware how much meaning lay in it  and so she told the crow about herself and her entire life and asked it if it hadn t seen Kay  ~newline~ but now he s probably forgotten you for the princess    Does he live with a princess   Gerda asked  ~newline~ The wisest of them had admittedly taken some sandwiches with them  but they didn t share them with the man next to them  for they thought  Just let him look hungry  then the princess won t take him    But Kay  little Kay   Gerda asked  ~newline~ And the princess looked out from the white lily bed and asked what was happening  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet  she was invited to stay at the palace and have a pleasant time  but all she asked for was to have a small carriage with a horse in front and a pair of small boots  and then she would be off again into the great wide world to find Kay  ~newline~   Do you know where Lapland is   she asked the reindeer  ~newline~  You re a fine fellow to go traipsing around   she said to little Kay   I wonder if you re worth running to the ends of the world for   But Gerda patted her on the cheek  and asked about the prince and princess  ~newline~  But the crow   little Gerda asked 
20,The Snow Queen,roses,Since the boxes were very high  and the children knew that they were not allowed to clamber up onto them  they were often both allowed to climb out to each other and sit on their small stools under the roses  and there they played so marvellously together  ~newline~ The roses bloomed so marvellously that summer  the little girl had learnt a hymn and it talked of roses  and when she read that she thought about her own roses  and she sang it for the little boy  and he joined in  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~   And they held each other by the hand  kissed the roses and gazed into God s bright sunshine and spoke to it as if the Christ child was there  ~newline~ they really are such ugly roses   they look like the boxes they re standing in   and he gave the box a hard shove with his foot and broke off the two roses  ~newline~ The old woman was afraid that when Gerda saw the roses  she would think of her own and then remember little Kay and run away  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~   Don t you know where he is   she asked the roses  ~newline~  Do you think he is dead and gone    He s not dead   the roses said  ~newline~ The roses have been down in the ground  and they say no    Ding  dong   the bells of the hyacinth rang  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ And they took each other by the hand and walked out of the large palace  they talked about grandmother and about the roses up on the roof  and wherever they walked  the winds died down and sun came out  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  the reindeer was standing there waiting for them  it had another young reindeer with it with a full udder  and it gave the young ones its warm milk and kissed them on the lips  ~newline~ The roses from the gutter bloomed in at the open windows  and there were the small children s     chairs  and Kay and Gerda sat down on them and held each other s hands   they had forgotten like some heavy dream the cold empty magnificence of the Snow Queen s palace  ~newline~ Grandmother was sitting in God s bright sunshine and was reading out loud from the Bible   Unless you become as little children  you will not enter the kingdom of Heaven   And Kay and Gerda looked into each other s eyes  and suddenly they understood the old hymn  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail 
20,The Snow Queen,right,She was very fine and beautiful  but made of ice  of blinding  twinkling ice  and yet she was alive  her eyes stared like two bright stars  although there was no calmness or rest in them  ~newline~ The little boy took fright and jumped down from the chair  it was as if a large bird flew past the window  ~newline~   And they held each other by the hand  kissed the roses and gazed into God s bright sunshine and spoke to it as if the Christ child was there  ~newline~ A tiny shard had also gone right into poor Kay s heart  ~newline~ and there isn t a single fault in them anywhere  they are perfectly accurate   as long as they don t melt   Shortly afterwards  Kay came along with big gloves and his sledge on his back  he shouted right into Gerda s ear   I ve been given permission to go sledging on the great square where the others play   and off he rushed  ~newline~ He was quite frightened  wanted to say his Lord s Prayer  but all he could remember was his multiplication table from ten to twenty  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~  You poor little child   the old woman said   how on earth have you ended up on the swift flowing river  carried far out into the great  wide world   and the old woman went right out into the water  caught hold of the boat with the curved end of her stick  pulled it ashore and lifted little Gerda out  ~newline~ What do the hyacinths say    There were three lovely sisters  so transparent and fine  the first one s dress was red  the second one s blue and the third one s completely white  hand in hand they danced by the still lake in the bright moonlight  ~newline~  You are a bright little sun   Gerda said  ~newline~ It was as if people in there had taken snuff and it had fallen onto their stomachs and they had fallen into a trance until they were back in the street   yes  then they could talk all right  ~newline~ There was a long line right from the city gate to the palace  ~newline~ it was on the third day when a little fellow turned up  without horse or carriage  marching quite unperturbed right up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had lovely long hair  but apart from that poor clothes    That was Kay   Gerda shouted with joy  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~ It s Kay all right   Gerda said   he was so clever he could do mental arithmetic with fractions  ~newline~ We will take the direct route  for we will not encounter anyone there    I think I can hear someone right behind us   Gerda said  and it swished past her  it was like shadows along the wall  horses with flowing manes and thin legs  hunting lads  gentlemen and ladies on horseback  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ Here are my mother s big mittens  they ll reach right up to your elbows   stick your hands in  ~newline~  You should be looking very pleased instead right now  ~newline~ They stopped at a tiny house  it was so pitiful  the roof went right down to the ground  and the door was so low that the family had to creep on their stomachs when they wanted to go in or out  ~newline~ There stood poor Gerda  without any shoes  without any mittens  in the middle of the frightful cold of Finnmark  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ The walls of the palace were of whirling snow and its windows and doors of biting winds  there were more than a hundred halls  formed as the snow drifted  the largest stretching many miles  all of them lit by the brightest northern lights  and they were so large  so empty  so icy cold and so gleaming  ~newline~ The northern lights gleamed so precisely that one could tell when they were turned right up and when they were screwed right down  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman  ~newline~ Grandmother was sitting in God s bright sunshine and was reading out loud from the Bible   Unless you become as little children  you will not enter the kingdom of Heaven   And Kay and Gerda looked into each other s eyes  and suddenly they understood the old hymn  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail 
19,The Snow Queen,red,One day he was in a really good mood  for he had made a mirror that had the property of reducing everything good and beautiful that was reflected in it into practically nothing  but whatever was fit for nothing and looked bad grew more pronounced and became even worse  ~newline~ If a good pious thought went through the mind of a person  a grin appeared in the mirror  so that the ogre devil had to laugh at his ingenious invention  ~newline~ The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ She was very fine and beautiful  but made of ice  of blinding  twinkling ice  and yet she was alive  her eyes stared like two bright stars  although there was no calmness or rest in them  ~newline~  My sledge  don t forget my sledge   he only remembered that now  and it was attached to one of the white hens  and it flew behind with the sledge on its back  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~  I don t believe it   they answered  and finally little Gerda didn t either  ~newline~  I ll put on my new  red shoes   she said one morning   Kay s never seen them  and I ll go down to the river and ask it     And it was quite early  she kissed the old grandmother  who was asleep  put on the red shoes and went all on her own out of the city gate to the river  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~ Then little Gerda felt quite scared and started to cry  but no one heard her except the house sparrows  and they could not carry her back to the shore  but they flew alongside it and sang  as if to comfort her   Here we are  ~newline~ here we are   The boat drifted with the current  little Gerda sat quite still in her stockinged feet  her small red shoes floated behind  but they couldn t reach the boat  it started to move faster  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~ The windows were high up and their panes were red  blue and yellow  the daylight shone so strangely inside there with every colour  but on the table were the loveliest cherries  and Gerda ate as many as she wished  for she dared to do so  ~newline~ every conceivable flower  and for every season of the year  stood here in all its glory  no picture book could be more many coloured and lovely  ~newline~ Gerda jumped for joy  and played until the sun set behind the tall cherry trees  then she was given a lovely bed with red silk duvets that were filled with blue violets  and she slept and dreamt in it as sweetly as any queen on her wedding day  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~   In her long  red sari the Hindu wife stands on the pyre  the flames rise up around her and her dead husband  but the Hindu woman thinks of the living one here in the circle  of him whose eyes burn more fiercely than the flames  of him whose eyes  fire reach her heart more than the flames that soon will turn her body into ashes  ~newline~    Out over the narrow mountain road hangs an old baronial castle  dense periwinkles grow up round its old red walls  leaf by leaf  up around the balcony where a lovely girl stands  she leans out over the balustrade and gazes down the road  ~newline~  I m only talking about my fairytale  my dream   the convolvulus answered  ~newline~ What do the hyacinths say    There were three lovely sisters  so transparent and fine  the first one s dress was red  the second one s blue and the third one s completely white  hand in hand they danced by the still lake in the bright moonlight  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ They now entered the first hall  it was of rose pink satin with imitation flowers up the walls  here the dreams already shot past them  but at such a pace that Gerda did not catch a glimpse of the royal household  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~ All the dreams came flying in once more  and then they looked like God s angels  and they pulled a small sledge  and on it sat Kay and nodded   but all of this was merely dreaming  which is why it had all disappeared again when she woke up  ~newline~    Inside  the coach was lined with sugared pretzels  and there were various types of fruit and small spicy biscuits in the seats  ~newline~ The little robber girl was as big as Gerda  but stronger  more broadshouldered and dark skinned  her eyes were quite black  so they almost looked sad  ~newline~ In the large  old  sooty hall a large fire was burning in the middle of the stone floor  the smoke gathered up under the roof and had to find its own way out  a large cauldron of soup was stewing  and both hares and rabbits were being turned on a spit  ~newline~ Above them      on lathes and perches  sat almost a hundred pigeons  all of which seemed to be asleep  although they turned slightly when the young girls came  ~newline~  Are you going to have the knife with you when you sleep   Gerda said and gave it a rather scared look  ~newline~  That is where I was born and bred  where I have cavorted on the fields of snow    Listen   the robber girl said to Gerda   you can see that all our men are away at the moment  but the old woman s still here  and she stays put  but during the morning she drinks from her big bottle and then takes a little nap    now I m going to do something for you   She leapt out of bed  went over to her mother s neck  pulled her by the whiskers and said   good morning  my fine little nanny goat   And her mother flicked her under the nose so it turned red and blue  but it was all out of pure affection  ~newline~ It was as if it sneezed red  ~newline~ Won t you give the little girl a potion  so she can have the strength of twelve men and overpower the Snow Queen    The strength of twelve men   the Finnmark woman said   yes  that should do the trick   and she went over to a shelf  took out a large rolled up hide and unrolled it  on it strange letters were written  and the Finnmark woman read away till the sweat poured down her forehead  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ The walls of the palace were of whirling snow and its windows and doors of biting winds  there were more than a hundred halls  formed as the snow drifted  the largest stretching many miles  all of them lit by the brightest northern lights  and they were so large  so empty  so icy cold and so gleaming  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ how empty and huge it is here   and he held on tight to Gerda  and she laughed and cried with joy  it was so wonderful that even the pieces of ice danced around with joy and when they were tired and lay down  they formed precisely the combination of letters the Snow Queen had said he was to try to find  so now he was his own master  and she would have to make him a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates  ~newline~ And they took each other by the hand and walked out of the large palace  they talked about grandmother and about the roses up on the roof  and wherever they walked  the winds died down and sun came out  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  the reindeer was standing there waiting for them  it had another young reindeer with it with a full udder  and it gave the young ones its warm milk and kissed them on the lips  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her  ~newline~  Well  the crow s dead   she answered  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
19,The Snow Queen,oh,No one knew where he was  many tears were shed  little Gerda wept profoundly and a long time    then they said that he was dead  had drowned in the river that ran close to the city  oh  these were drawn out  dismal winter days  ~newline~  Oh  oh  what a fragrance I have  ~newline~ oh  how delicious she ll taste   and she drew out her shiny knife and it gleamed in a horrible way  ~newline~ they ll fly off at once if one doesn t have them securely behind bars  and here s my dear old Pooh   and she pulled out by the antlers a reindeer that had a shiny copper ring round its neck and was bound  ~newline~ Translated into English by John Irons in      for the Hans Christian Andersen Centre at the University of Southern Denmark 
19,The Snow Queen,back,and there isn t a single fault in them anywhere  they are perfectly accurate   as long as they don t melt   Shortly afterwards  Kay came along with big gloves and his sledge on his back  he shouted right into Gerda s ear   I ve been given permission to go sledging on the great square where the others play   and off he rushed  ~newline~ It went faster and faster into the next street  the person driving it looked backwards and nodded to Kay in a friendly way  almost as if they knew each other  each time Kay wanted to unfasten his small sledge  the person nodded once more  and Kay stayed where he was  they drove straight out of the city gate  ~newline~  My sledge  don t forget my sledge   he only remembered that now  and it was attached to one of the white hens  and it flew behind with the sledge on its back  ~newline~ The Snow Queen kissed Kay once more  and then he had forgotten little Gerda and grandmother and all of them back home  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~ Then little Gerda felt quite scared and started to cry  but no one heard her except the house sparrows  and they could not carry her back to the shore  but they flew alongside it and sang  as if to comfort her   Here we are  ~newline~ And Gerda was glad to get back onto dry land  though a bit afraid of the strange  old woman  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~ But I ll soon be back  and I ll have Kay with me  ~newline~ The other day she s sitting on the throne  and that is not all that much fun  people say  when she happens to start humming a tune that is precisely this one   Why shouldn t I get married    Hey  that s not a bad idea   she says  and was so eager to get married  but she wanted to have a husband that knew how to answer back when talked to  one that didn t just stand there looking fine   for that s so boring  ~newline~ All of them were well able to speak when they were out in the street  but the moment they entered the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all clad in silver  and on the staircase the footmen clad in gold and the huge  illuminated halls  they were taken aback  and as soon as they were before the throne where the princess was sitting  all they could manage was to repeat the last word she had said  and she wasn t interested in hearing that again  ~newline~ It was as if people in there had taken snuff and it had fallen onto their stomachs and they had fallen into a trance until they were back in the street   yes  then they could talk all right  ~newline~  He had a small knapsack on his back   the crow said  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~ it was as if she was about to do something bad  and in fact all she wanted to do was find out if it really was little Kay  yes  it had to be him  she thought so intensely of his intelligent eyes  his long hair  she could clearly see how he smiled  like he did when they sat back home under the roses  ~newline~ We will take the direct route  for we will not encounter anyone there    I think I can hear someone right behind us   Gerda said  and it swished past her  it was like shadows along the wall  horses with flowing manes and thin legs  hunting lads  gentlemen and ladies on horseback  ~newline~   She called his name out quite loud  held the lamp closer to him   the dreams swished on horseback back into the room   he woke up  turned his head and     it wasn t little Kay  ~newline~ It was only the back of the prince s neck that resembled him  although he was young and handsome  ~newline~ The forest crow  which had now got married  accompanied them the first twenty miles or so  it sat next to her  for it couldn t travel backwards  the other crow stood at the gate and flapped its wings  it didn t accompany them  for it had a headache  since it now had a permanent position and had eaten too much  ~newline~  Ow   the old woman suddenly cried out  she had been bitten in the ear by her own little daughter  who hung on her back and was so wild and unkempt it was a joy to see  ~newline~  There the forest rascals are sitting   she continued and further back showed a host of bars that had been fixed in front of a hole high up in the wall  ~newline~ A dozen miles from here the Snow Queen s garden starts  you can carry the little girl up to that point  set her down by the large bush that stands in the snow with its red berries  don t stand there chatting away and hurry back here   And then the Finnmark woman lifted little Gerda up onto the reindeer  who sped off as swiftly as it could  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again 
19,The Snow Queen,ice,The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ She was very fine and beautiful  but made of ice  of blinding  twinkling ice  and yet she was alive  her eyes stared like two bright stars  although there was no calmness or rest in them  ~newline~ For it was one of the specks of glass that came from the mirror  the magic mirror   remember   the horrid glass that made everything large and good that was reflected in it become tiny and horrible  but what was evil and nasty became more obvious  and everything wrong with something was immediately noticeable  ~newline~ Soon his heart would be like a lump of ice  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ The boys could only say that they had seen him tie his small sledge to a magnificent large sleigh that drove off into the street and out at the city gate  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the

No rose hangs fresher from its branches than she does  no apple blossom  when the wind carries it from the tree  floats more lightly than she does  how magnificently her silken dress rustles  ~newline~ She pours water from the teapot onto a piece of clothing she is holding  it is her bodice    cleanliness is next to godliness  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~     My fianc  has said such nice things about you  little miss   the tame crow said   your Vita  as it is called  is also extremely moving  ~newline~ Do you know anything about that    She s sure to have been on her way to Lapland  for there is always snow and ice there  ~newline~ just ask the reindeer who s bound on the rope    There s ice and snow there  it s wonderful and marvellous there   the reindeer said   there you can run around freely in the vast gleaming valleys  ~newline~ and here are two loaves and a ham for you  so you won t go hungry   Both were fixed behind her on the reindeer  the little robber girl opened the door  enticed all the big dogs inside  and then she cut through the rope and said to the reindeer   Off you run  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while

 But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ Little Kay was quite blue with cold  yes  almost black  but he didn t notice it even so  for   remember   she had kissed the shiver of cold off him  and his heart was practically a lump of ice  ~newline~ He was dragging some sharp flat pieces of ice around with him  which he combined in all sorts of ways  for he wanted to make something out of them  it was just like when we have small slabs of wood and make figures out of them  which we call the Chinese Game  ~newline~ Kay was also trying to make figures  the most ingenious of all  it was the ice game of reason  to his eyes  the figures were quite excellent and of the utmost importance   it was the speck of glass in his eye that made him see things like that  ~newline~ that s all part of it  it s good on top of lemons and grapes   and off flew the Snow Queen  and Kay sat all on his own in the many mile long empty ice hall and looked at the pieces of ice and racked his brains till they creaked  he sat there stiff and still  he looked as if he had frozen to death  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ how empty and huge it is here   and he held on tight to Gerda  and she laughed and cried with joy  it was so wonderful that even the pieces of ice danced around with joy and when they were tired and lay

~newline~ Soon his heart would be like a lump of ice  ~newline~ Everything that was a bit odd about them and not very fetching Kay was able to imitate  and then people said   That boy s certainly got

also read all the newspapers that exist in the world  and forgotten them again   she is that clever  ~newline~ The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet  she was invited to stay at the palace and have a pleasant time  but all she asked for was to have a small carriage with a horse in front and a pair of small boots  and then she would be off again into the great wide world to find Kay  ~newline~ But say again what you told me about little Kay  and why you set out into the great wide world   And Gerda told her from the beginning  and the pigeons cooed up there in their cage   the other pigeons slept  ~newline~  You are so wise   the reindeer said   I know you can tie up all the winds in the world on a piece of sewing thread  if the skipper undoes the one knot  he gets a fair wind  if he undoes the other  it blows hard  and if he undoes the third and fourth  there is such a gale that the forests blow down  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ Can t you see how humans and animals have to serve her  how she has managed to get so far in the world on her own bare feet  ~newline~ In the very middle of the empty endless snow hall there was a frozen lake  it had cracked into a thousand pieces  but each piece resembled the next one completely  so that it was nothing less than a feat  and in the middle of it the Snow Queen sat when at home  and then she said that she sat in the mirror of reason  and that this was the only and best thing in the world  ~newline~ he composed whole figures which were a written word   but he never succeeded in forming the exact word that he wanted  the word Eternity  and the Snow Queen had said   If you can make that word out for me  you shall be your own master  and I will make you a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates   But he was unable to  ~newline~ how empty and huge it is here   and he held on tight to Gerda  and she laughed and cried with joy  it was so wonderful that even the pieces of ice danced around with joy and when they were tired and lay down  they formed precisely the combination of letters the Snow Queen had said he was to try to find  so now he was his own master  and she would have to make him a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates  ~newline~  You re a fine fellow to go traipsing around   she said to little Kay   I wonder if you re worth running to the ends of the world for   But Gerda patted her on the cheek  and asked about the prince and princess  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
19,The Snow Queen,everything,One day he was in a really good mood  for he had made a mirror that had the property of reducing everything good and beautiful that was reflected in it into practically nothing  but whatever was fit for nothing and looked bad grew more pronounced and became even worse  ~newline~ The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ The next day there was a clear frost    and then it began to thaw  the sun shone  everything turned green  the swallows built their nests  the windows were opened  and the small children sat once more in their tiny garden high up in the gutter above all the storeys of the houses  ~newline~ For it was one of the specks of glass that came from the mirror  the magic mirror   remember   the horrid glass that made everything large and good that was reflected in it become tiny and horrible  but what was evil and nasty became more obvious  and everything wrong with something was immediately noticeable  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~ And Gerda told her everything  and the old woman shook her head and said  Hm  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~  I have a tame sweetheart who is free to walk around the palace  and she s told me everything   His sweetheart was a crow too  of course  for birds of a feather flock together  which in this case always means a crow  ~newline~ Then little Gerda cried and told them her entire story and everything that the crows had done for her  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ Are you really a princess    No   little Gerda said and told her everything she had experienced  and how fond she was of little Kay  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells

19,The Snow Queen,know,When we re at the end of the story we ll know more than we do now  for it has to do with an evil ogre  ~newline~   Don t you know where he is   she asked the roses  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~  We do not toll for Kay  him we do not know  ~newline~ we are just singing our song  the only one we know   And Gerda went over to the buttercup  which could be seen gleaming among the shiny  green leaves  ~newline~  Tell me if you know where I can find my playmate   And the buttercup shone so beautifully and looked at Gerda once more  ~newline~   Asking the flowers isn t any help  all they know is their own song  they can t tell me anything   And so she tied up her little skirt  so that she could run faster  but the narcissus struck her over the leg as she jumped over it  then she stopped up  looked at the tall yellow flower and asked   Do you know something  perhaps   and bent down to it  ~newline~  I think I know    I think it might just be little Kay  ~newline~ but I know from my tame sweetheart that when he came in at the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all in silver and on the staircase the footmen all in gold  he wasn t the slightest bit overawed  he nodded and said to them   It must be boring standing on the stairs  I think I d rather go inside   There he came to halls glittering with light  privy councillors and excellencies walked around on their bare feet and carried gold dishes   the more ceremony the better  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~ He would of course be glad to see her  hear about the long way she had come for his sake  know how sorrowful everyone at home had been when he didn t return  ~newline~  You never know what might happen  ~newline~ The little robber girl placed her arm round Gerda s neck  held the knife in the other hand and fell noisily asleep  but Gerda simply couldn t close her eyes  she didn t know if she was going to live or die  ~newline~ Do you know anything about that    She s sure to have been on her way to Lapland  for there is always snow and ice there  ~newline~   Do you know where Lapland is   she asked the reindeer  ~newline~  Who could know better than I can   the animal said  and its eyes rolled in its head  ~newline~  You are so wise   the reindeer said   I know you can tie up all the winds in the world on a piece of sewing thread  if the skipper undoes the one knot  he gets a fair wind  if he undoes the other  it blows hard  and if he undoes the third and fourth  there is such a gale that the forests blow down  ~newline~ But know we must first have a look at how Kay is getting on 
18,The Snow Queen,cold, Are you still freezing cold   she asked  and then kissed him on the forehead  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~ They flew over forests and lakes  over seas and lands  beneath them the cold wind roared  the wolves howled  the snow glittered  with black screeching crows flying above it  but above everything the moon shone so large and bright  and Kay gazed at it the long  long wintry night  during the day he slept at the Snow Queen s feet  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~  It s all the same   she said   here are your furry boots  for it will be cold  but I ll keep the muff myself  it s too delightful  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~ I ve forgotten my mittens   little Gerda cried out  she could feel this in the biting cold  but the reindeer didn t dare stop  it ran until it came to the large bush with the red berries  there it set Gerda down  kissed her on the lips  and large  glistening tears ran down its cheeks  and it ran back  as swiftly as it could  back again  ~newline~ There stood poor Gerda  without any shoes  without any mittens  in the middle of the frightful cold of Finnmark  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ The angels patted her feet and hands  so she should feel less how cold they were  and walked briskly on towards the Snow Queen s palace  ~newline~ The walls of the palace were of whirling snow and its windows and doors of biting winds  there were more than a hundred halls  formed as the snow drifted  the largest stretching many miles  all of them lit by the brightest northern lights  and they were so large  so empty  so icy cold and so gleaming  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~ Little Kay was quite blue with cold  yes  almost black  but he didn t notice it even so  for   remember   she had kissed the shiver of cold off him  and his heart was practically a lump of ice  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~  How cold it is here  ~newline~ The roses from the gutter bloomed in at the open windows  and there were the small children s     chairs  and Kay and Gerda sat down on them and held each other s hands   they had forgotten like some heavy dream the cold empty magnificence of the Snow Queen s palace 
18,The Snow Queen,great,It was when Kay and Gerda sat there looking at a picture book with animals and birds   the clock was just striking five on the great church steeple   that Kay said   Ow  something s stuck me in the heart  ~newline~ and there isn t a single fault in them anywhere  they are perfectly accurate   as long as they don t melt   Shortly afterwards  Kay came along with big gloves and his sledge on his back  he shouted right into Gerda s ear   I ve been given permission to go sledging on the great square where the others play   and off he rushed  ~newline~ That was great fun  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~  You poor little child   the old woman said   how on earth have you ended up on the swift flowing river  carried far out into the great  wide world   and the old woman went right out into the water  caught hold of the boat with the curved end of her stick  pulled it ashore and lifted little Gerda out  ~newline~ The door was shut  but she wriggled the rusty hasp till it came loose  and the door sprung open  and then little Gerda ran off on her bare feet into the great wide world  ~newline~ Oh  how grey and heavy it was in the great wide world  ~newline~ goodday   That was the best it could manage  but it was so well meaning with the little girl and it asked her where she was heading alone in the great wide world  ~newline~ The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet  she was invited to stay at the palace and have a pleasant time  but all she asked for was to have a small carriage with a horse in front and a pair of small boots  and then she would be off again into the great wide world to find Kay  ~newline~ Now the coach came to a stop  there in the middle of the courtyard of a robber s castle  there were great cracks in it from top to bottom  ravens and crows flew out of the open holes  and the huge fierce dogs  each of which looked as if it could swallow a whole human being  leapt high into the air  but they didn t bark  for that was forbidden  ~newline~ But say again what you told me about little Kay  and why you set out into the great wide world   And Gerda told her from the beginning  and the pigeons cooed up there in their cage   the other pigeons slept  ~newline~ but take good care of the little girl   And Gerda stretched out her hands  with the large mittens on  out towards the robber girl and said goodbye  and the reindeer shot off over shrubs and tree stumps through the great forest  over bogs and steppes  as fast as it could  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ can t you see how great that is  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ She knew Gerda immediately and Gerda knew her   and there was great happiness  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
18,The Snow Queen,told, Just let her try and come in  the boy said   and I ll put her on the hot stove  and then she ll melt   But the grandmother smoothed his hair and told them other stories  ~newline~ When she later came with the picture book  he said that it was only for babies  and if the grandmother told them stories  he always came up with some objection   and if he could  he would follow after her  put a pair of glasses on and speak exactly the way she did   so convincingly that it made people laugh at him  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ And Gerda told her everything  and the old woman shook her head and said  Hm  ~newline~ The world  alone  Gerda understood perfectly well and was well aware how much meaning lay in it  and so she told the crow about herself and her entire life and asked it if it hadn t seen Kay  ~newline~ If only I had learnt it    No matter   the crow said   I ll tell you as best I can  but it won t be all that good even so   and then he told her what he knew  ~newline~  I have a tame sweetheart who is free to walk around the palace  and she s told me everything   His sweetheart was a crow too  of course  for birds of a feather flock together  which in this case always means a crow  ~newline~ Then little Gerda cried and told them her entire story and everything that the crows had done for her  ~newline~ Are you really a princess    No   little Gerda said and told her everything she had experienced  and how fond she was of little Kay  ~newline~ But say again what you told me about little Kay  and why you set out into the great wide world   And Gerda told her from the beginning  and the pigeons cooed up there in their cage   the other pigeons slept  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~ You ve heard what she told me  for she spoke loudly enough and you were eavesdropping   The reindeer leapt into the air with joy  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~ I ll write a few words on some split cod  I haven t any paper  I ll give it to you for the Finnmark woman up there  she can give you better directions than I can   And when Gerda had been warmed up and had something to eat and drink  the Lapp woman wrote a few words on some split cod  told Gerda to take good care of it  bound her to the reindeer once more and off it leapt  ~newline~    First the reindeer told its story  then little Gerda s  and the Finnmark woman blinked her wise eyes  but didn t say anything  ~newline~ She must not be told of her power by us  it resides in her heart  it exists because she is a sweet innocent child  ~newline~   But tell me how things have gone for you  and how you managed to get hold of him   And both Gerda and Kay told her 
18,The Snow Queen,round,They ran around with the mirror  and finally there wasn t a country or a single person that had not been distorted in it  ~newline~ The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ But there were even more shards of glass flying around everywhere in the air  ~newline~ The long pea stalks hung down over the edges of the boxes  and the rose trees grew long branches  wound themselves round the windows  bent towards each other  It was almost like a triumphal arch of greenery and flowers  ~newline~ The windows were often completely frozen shut  but they would heat small copper coins on the tiled stove  place a hot coin on the frozen windowpane and it would form so round  perfectly round a fine peephole  behind which a wonderfully mild eye would peer out  one from each window   that of the little boy and the little girl  ~newline~ she is the largest of them all  and she never remains still on the ground  she keeps on flying up into the black cloud  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ creep into my bear fur coat   and she placed him in the sleigh with her  wrapped the fur round him  it felt like sinking into a snowdrift  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~ And while she was eating  the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb  and her hair curled and shone so beautifully round the small  friendly face that was so round and resembled a rose  ~newline~ The old woman had forgotten to take it off her bonnet when she spirited all the others down into the ground  ~newline~  What s this   Gerda said   There aren t any roses here   and she sprang in between the flower beds  searching and searching  but there were none to be found  then she sat down and cried  but her warm tears fell precisely where a rose tree had sunk into the ground  and when the warm tears watered the soil  the tree shot up again  as much in flower as when it had sunk down  and Gerda embraced it  kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses back home   and when she did so  she also thought of little Kay  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~   In her long  red sari the Hindu wife stands on the pyre  the flames rise up around her and her dead husband  but the Hindu woman thinks of the living one here in the circle  of him whose eyes burn more fiercely than the flames  of him whose eyes  fire reach her heart more than the flames that soon will turn her body into ashes  ~newline~    Out over the narrow mountain road hangs an old baronial castle  dense periwinkles grow up round its old red walls  leaf by leaf  up around the balcony where a lovely girl stands  she leans out over the balustrade and gazes down the road  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for in one hand he is holding a small bowl  in the other a clay pipe  he is blowing soapbubbles  the swing swings  and the soap bubbles fly out in lovely  changing colours  the last one is still hanging on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~ There was such a sweet scent  and the girls went off into the forest  the scent grew stronger   three coffins  in which the lovely girls lay down  glided out from the thicket out across the lake  glow worms flew round them  glimmering like small floating lights  ~newline~ The roses have been down in the ground  and they say no    Ding  dong   the bells of the hyacinth rang  ~newline~ her white dress is hanging on its hook  it has also been washed in the tea pot and dried on the roof  she puts it on  the saffron yellow scarf round her neck  then her dress gleams even whiter  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ Oh  how her small feet were sore and tired  and everything around her seemed to be cold and raw  the long willow leaves had turned quite yellow and mist dripped from them in drops of water  one leaf after the other was falling  only the blackthorn still had fruit on it that was so sour it made one purse one s lips  ~newline~  I have a tame sweetheart who is free to walk around the palace  and she s told me everything   His sweetheart was a crow too  of course  for birds of a feather flock together  which in this case always means a crow  ~newline~ but I know from my tame sweetheart that when he came in at the palace gate and saw the lifeguards all in silver and on the staircase the footmen all in gold  he wasn t the slightest bit overawed  he nodded and said to them   It must be boring standing on the stairs  I think I d rather go inside   There he came to halls glittering with light  privy councillors and excellencies walked around on their bare feet and carried gold dishes   the more ceremony the better  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~  She s to give me her muff  her beautiful dress  sleep with me in my bed   and she bit her mother again  so the robber woman leapt into the air and turned round  and all the robbers laughed and said   See  how she dances with her young brat    I want to go inside the coach   the little robber girl said and simply had to have her will  for she was so spoilt and so stubborn  ~newline~ they ll fly off at once if one doesn t have them securely behind bars  and here s my dear old Pooh   and she pulled out by the antlers a reindeer that had a shiny copper ring round its neck and was bound  ~newline~ The little robber girl placed her arm round Gerda s neck  held the knife in the other hand and fell noisily asleep  but Gerda simply couldn t close her eyes  she didn t know if she was going to live or die  ~newline~ The robbers were sitting round the fire  singing and drinking  and the old robber woman was doing somersaults  ~newline~ just ask the reindeer who s bound on the rope    There s ice and snow there  it s wonderful and marvellous there   the reindeer said   there you can run around freely in the vast gleaming valleys  ~newline~ They stopped at a tiny house  it was so pitiful  the roof went right down to the ground  and the door was so low that the family had to creep on their stomachs when they wanted to go in or out  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ Then little Gerda said her Lord s Prayer  and the cold was so severe that she could see her own breath  it stood out from her mouth like a great cloud of smoke  her breath became increasingly dense and formed itself into small bright angels that grew larger and larger when they touched the ground  and all of them were wearing helmets on their heads and were holding spears and shields in their hands  they grew in number  and when Gerda had finished her Lord s Prayer  there was a whole legion around     her  they jabbed at the horrible snowflakes with their spears and the snowflakes broke into a hundred pieces  and little Gerda was able to move on safe and undaunted  ~newline~ He was dragging some sharp flat pieces of ice around with him  which he combined in all sorts of ways  for he wanted to make something out of them  it was just like when we have small slabs of wood and make figures out of them  which we call the Chinese Game  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ And where have I been   And he looked around him  ~newline~ how empty and huge it is here   and he held on tight to Gerda  and she laughed and cried with joy  it was so wonderful that even the pieces of ice danced around with joy and when they were tired and lay down  they formed precisely the combination of letters the Snow Queen had said he was to try to find  so now he was his own master  and she would have to make him a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates  ~newline~  You re a fine fellow to go traipsing around   she said to little Kay   I wonder if you re worth running to the ends of the world for   But Gerda patted her on the cheek  and asked about the prince and princess  ~newline~  The tame sweetheart is now a widow and goes around with a small piece of black wool round her leg  she complains so pitifully and it s nonsense  all of it  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults 
18,The Snow Queen,many,In the big city  where there are so many houses and people so that there is not enough space for everyone to have a little garden  and where most people for that reason have to make do with flowers in pots  there were two poor children who nevertheless had a garden that was a bit bigger than a flowerpot  ~newline~ In the summer they could get together by taking one big step  in the winter they first had to go down many stairs and up many stairs   outside the snow was swirling  ~newline~ On many a winter night she flies through the city streets and looks in through the windows  and then they freeze over so strangely  as if with flowers    Yes  I ve seen that   both the children said  and so they knew it was true  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ No one knew where he was  many tears were shed  little Gerda wept profoundly and a long time    then they said that he was dead  had drowned in the river that ran close to the city  oh  these were drawn out  dismal winter days  ~newline~  Perhaps the river will carry me to where little Kay is   Gerda thought and that put her in a better mood  she sat up and gazed for many hours at the beautiful green shores  then she came to a large cherry orchard where there was a small house with strange red and blue windows  not to mention a thatched roof and outside two wooden soldiers that presented arms to anyone sailing past  ~newline~ The windows were high up and their panes were red  blue and yellow  the daylight shone so strangely inside there with every colour  but on the table were the loveliest cherries  and Gerda ate as many as she wished  for she dared to do so  ~newline~ every conceivable flower  and for every season of the year  stood here in all its glory  no picture book could be more many coloured and lovely  ~newline~ The next day she could play again with the flowers in the warm sunshine   and many days passed like this  ~newline~ Gerda knew every kind of flower  but no matter how many there were  she felt that one was missing  but which one she was unable to say  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~ Was he among all those many people    Be patient  ~newline~  I m to give you her many greetings  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ And when her mother had drunk from her bottle and was taking a little nap  the robber girl went over to the reindeer and said   I really have this peculiar urge to tickle you many more times with the     sharp knife  for you are such fun then  but no matter   I will loosen your rope and help you outside  so you can run off to Lapland  but you must go as fast as ever you can and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen s palace  where her playmate is  ~newline~ The walls of the palace were of whirling snow and its windows and doors of biting winds  there were more than a hundred halls  formed as the snow drifted  the largest stretching many miles  all of them lit by the brightest northern lights  and they were so large  so empty  so icy cold and so gleaming  ~newline~ that s all part of it  it s good on top of lemons and grapes   and off flew the Snow Queen  and Kay sat all on his own in the many mile long empty ice hall and looked at the pieces of ice and racked his brains till they creaked  he sat there stiff and still  he looked as if he had frozen to death 
18,The Snow Queen,around,They ran around with the mirror  and finally there wasn t a country or a single person that had not been distorted in it  ~newline~ But there were even more shards of glass flying around everywhere in the air  ~newline~ it was colder than ice  it went right to his heart  which had already half turned into a lump of ice  it was as if he was going to die    but only for a moment  then it felt fine  he could no longer notice the cold around him  ~newline~   In her long  red sari the Hindu wife stands on the pyre  the flames rise up around her and her dead husband  but the Hindu woman thinks of the living one here in the circle  of him whose eyes burn more fiercely than the flames  of him whose eyes  fire reach her heart more than the flames that soon will turn her body into ashes  ~newline~    Out over the narrow mountain road hangs an old baronial castle  dense periwinkles grow up round its old red walls  leaf by leaf  up around the balcony where a lovely girl stands  she leans out over the balustrade and gazes down the road  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large

18,The Snow Queen,even,  THE SNOW QUEEN A fairytale in seven stories First story  which deals with the mirror and the shards of glass  ~newline~ One day he was in a really good mood  for he had made a mirror that had the property of reducing everything good and beautiful that was reflected in it into practically nothing  but whatever was fit for nothing and looked bad grew more pronounced and became even worse  ~newline~ The higher they flew with the mirror  the louder it laughed  they could hardly hold onto it  higher and higher they flew  closer to God and the angels  then the mirror shook so violently as it grinned that it shot out of their hands and crashed down onto the ground  where it shattered into hundreds of millions  billions and even more pieces  and that was precisely what caused even more misfortune than before  for some of the pieces were scarcely as big as a grain of sand  and these flew all over the world  and wherever they got into people s eyes  they stayed put and then those people saw everything wrong  or only had eyes for what was bad about something  for every speck of the mirror had retained the same power as the whole mirror had possessed  some people even got a tiny mirrorshard in their heart  and that was quite horrible   the heart became like a lump of ice  ~newline~ But there were even more shards of glass flying around everywhere in the air  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ Everything that was a bit odd about them and not very fetching Kay was able to imitate  and then people said   That boy s certainly got a clever head on his shoulders   but it was the piece of glass he had got in his eye  the glass that was lodged in his heart  that was why he teased even little Gerda  who loved him with all her soul  ~newline~ Gerda called out even louder  and then and old  old woman came out of the house  leaning on a stick curved at one end  she was wearing a large sun bonnet  and on it the loveliest of flowers had been painted  ~newline~ her white dress is hanging on its hook  it has also been washed in the tea pot and dried on the roof  she puts it on  the saffron yellow scarf round her neck  then her dress gleams even whiter  ~newline~ If only I had learnt it    No matter   the crow said   I ll tell you as best I can  but it won t be all that good even so   and then he told her what he knew  ~newline~  And Kay won the princess even so then    If I hadn t been a crow  I d have taken her myself  despite the fact that I m engaged  ~newline~   It s not possible for you to get inside the palace  for you are barefoot  the lifeguards in silver and footmen in gold wouldn t allow it  but don t cry  we ll get you up there even so  ~newline~ Every single evening I tickle his throat with my sharp knife   he s so afraid of that   and the little girl pulled a long knife out of a cleft in the wall and let it glide over the reindeer s neck  the poor animal kicked out with its legs  and the robber girl laughed and pulled down Gerda with her onto the bed  ~newline~ The robber girl lifted little Gerda up and took the precaution of binding her  even of giving her a cushion to sit on  ~newline~ But I won t let you freeze even so  ~newline~  Those are my old northern lights   the reindeer said   just look at how they gleam   and it shot off even faster  night and day  the loaves were eaten  the ham too and then they were in Lapland  ~newline~ You have to cover     miles or so into Finnmark  for there the Snow Queen is out in the country  burning blue lights every single evening  ~newline~ whoosh   it said up in the sky  all night long the loveliest blue northern lights gleamed    and then they came to Finnmark and knocked on the chimney of the Finnmark woman  for she didn t even have a door  ~newline~ Seventh story  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~ Little Kay was quite blue with cold  yes  almost black  but he didn t notice it even so  for   remember   she had kissed the shiver of cold off him  and his heart was practically a lump of ice  ~newline~ It was at this moment that little Gerda entered the palace through the great gate made of biting winds  but she said an evening prayer and the winds lay down as if they wanted to sleep  and she entered the large  empty  cold halls   then she caught sight of Kay  knew him  threw her arms round his neck  held him tight and called out  ~newline~ how empty and huge it is here   and he held on tight to Gerda  and she laughed and cried with joy  it was so wonderful that even the pieces of ice danced around with joy and when they were tired and lay down  they formed precisely the combination of letters the Snow Queen had said he was to try to find  so now he was his own master  and she would have to make him a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates 
17,The Snow Queen,look,One day he was in a really good mood  for he had made a mirror that had the property of reducing everything good and beautiful that was reflected in it into practically nothing  but whatever was fit for nothing and looked bad grew more pronounced and became even worse  ~newline~ The loveliest landscapes looked like boiled spinach in it  and the best of people turned ugly or stood on their heads with no stomach  their faces became so distorted that they were unrecognisable  and if someone had a freckle  you could be sure that it spread out over both nose and mouth  ~newline~ Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ Some pieces of the mirror were so large that they were used for window panes  but it wasn t worth looking at one s friends through that pane  others were put in spectacles  and things went badly when people put on those glasses so as to see clearly and be just  the evil ogre laughed till his stomach burst  and that tickled him so wonderfully  ~newline~ The parents came to place the boxes across the gutter so that they almost reached from one window to the other and they looked almost exactly like two embankments of flowers  ~newline~ On many a winter night she flies through the city streets and looks in through the windows  and then they freeze over so strangely  as if with flowers    Yes  I ve seen that   both the children said  and so they knew it was true  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ It was when Kay and Gerda sat there looking at a picture book with animals and birds   the clock was just striking five on the great church steeple   that Kay said   Ow  something s stuck me in the heart  ~newline~  What are you crying for   he asked  It makes you look ugly  ~newline~ and look  that one s all crooked  ~newline~ they really are such ugly roses   they look like the boxes they re standing in   and he gave the box a hard shove with his foot and broke off the two roses  ~newline~  Just look in the glass  Gerda   he said  and every snowflake became much larger and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten pointed star   it was lovely to look at  ~newline~ It went faster and faster into the next street  the person driving it looked backwards and nodded to Kay in a friendly way  almost as if they knew each other  each time Kay wanted to unfasten his small sledge  the person nodded once more  and Kay stayed where he was  they drove straight out of the city gate  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ hm   and when Gerda had said everything to her and asked her if she hadn t seen little Kay  the woman said that he had not passed by  but that he was sure to do so  and that she was not to be sad but to taste her cherries  look at her flowers   they were more beautiful than any picture book  and each of them could tell an entire story  ~newline~ Then one day she was sitting looking at the old woman s sun bonnet with the flowers painted on it  and the most beautiful of them all happened to be a rose  ~newline~  We ve been in the ground where all the dead are  but Kay wasn t there    Thank you  all of you   little Gerda said and she went over to the other flowers and looked into their calyces and asked   Don t you know where little Kay is   But every flower stood there in the sun and dreamt its own fairytale or story  Gerda got so very many of them  but not one knew anything about Kay  ~newline~  Tell me if you know where I can find my playmate   And the buttercup shone so beautifully and looked at Gerda once more  ~newline~   Asking the flowers isn t any help  all they know is their own song  they can t tell me anything   And so she tied up her little skirt  so that she could run faster  but the narcissus struck her over the leg as she jumped over it  then she stopped up  looked at the tall yellow flower and asked   Do you know something  perhaps   and bent down to it  ~newline~ She look behind her three times  but no one followed her  finally she couldn t run any longer and she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked around her the summer was over  it was late in the autumn   that she had not been able to notice in the lovely garden  where there was always sunshine and flowers of every season  ~newline~ Gerda had to take another rest  then a large crow hopped over the snow opposite where she sat  after sitting there for a long while  looking at her and waggling its head it said   Caw  ~newline~ The other day she s sitting on the throne  and that is not all that much fun  people say  when she happens to start humming a tune that is precisely this one   Why shouldn t I get married    Hey  that s not a bad idea   she says  and was so eager to get married  but she wanted to have a husband that knew how to answer back when talked to  one that didn t just stand there looking fine   for that s so boring  ~newline~ I was in there to have a look myself   the crow said  ~newline~ The wisest of them had admittedly taken some sandwiches with them  but they didn t share them with the man next to them  for they thought  Just let him look hungry  then the princess won t take him    But Kay  little Kay   Gerda asked  ~newline~  No  that must have been his sledge   Gerda said   for he had a sledge with him when he left       That may well be   the crow said   I didn t look all that closely  ~newline~ his boots creaked so terribly loudly  but he wasn t the slightest bit afraid    That s Kay all right   Gerda said   I know he had new boots  I ve heard them creaking in grandmother s room    Well  they certainly did creak   the crow said  and he walked as calm as you please right up to the princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel  and all the ladies in waiting with their maids  and maid s maids  and all the lords in waiting with their servants and servant s servants with their pages stood lined up around her  and the closer they stood by the door  the prouder they looked  ~newline~ The servant s servant s page  who always wears slippers  is almost impossible to look at  so proudly does he stand at the door    That must be horrible   little Gerda said  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~ And the princess looked out from the white lily bed and asked what was happening  ~newline~ All the dreams came flying in once more  and then they looked like God s angels  and they pulled a small sledge  and on it sat Kay and nodded   but all of this was merely dreaming  which is why it had all disappeared again when she woke up  ~newline~ The little robber girl was as big as Gerda  but stronger  more broadshouldered and dark skinned  her eyes were quite black  so they almost looked sad  ~newline~ The robber girl looked at her very seriously  nodded slightly and said   They are not going to kill you  and if I nevertheless should happen to get angry with you  I d rather do it myself   and then she dried Gerda s eyes and stuffed both her hands in the lovely muff  which was so soft and so warm  ~newline~ Now the coach came to a stop  there in the middle of the courtyard of a robber s castle  there were great cracks in it from top to bottom  ravens and crows flew out of the open holes  and the huge fierce dogs  each of which looked as if it could swallow a whole human being  leapt high into the air  but they didn t bark  for that was forbidden  ~newline~  Are you going to have the knife with you when you sleep   Gerda said and gave it a rather scared look  ~newline~  Lie still  now   the robber girl said   otherwise I ll stick my knife in your stomach   In the morning Gerda told her everything the woodpigeons had said  and the little robber girl looked quite serious  but nodded and said   It s all the same  ~newline~ Now your hands look just like those of my hideous mother   And Gerda cried with joy  ~newline~  You should be looking very pleased instead right now  ~newline~  Those are my old northern lights   the reindeer said   just look at how they gleam   and it shot off even faster  night and day  the loaves were eaten  the ham too and then they were in Lapland  ~newline~ But the reindeer entreated the woman on Gerda s behalf yet again  and Gerda looked at the Finnmark woman with such imploring  tear filled eyes that the woman blinked her own once more and drew the reindeer over into a corner  where she whispered to it  while giving it a fresh piece of ice on its head   It s true that little Kay is with the Snow Queen  and finds everything perfect there and believes it is the best place in the world  but that is because he has got a shard of glass in his heart and a small speck of glass in his eye  they must be removed  otherwise he can never become a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him    But can t you find something for little Gerda that will give her power over everything    I can t give her greater power than she already has  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ But know we must first have a look at how Kay is getting on  ~newline~  Now I m going to swish off to the warm countries   the Snow Queen said   I want to look down into the black cauldrons     These were the fire spewing mountains of Etna and Vesuvius  as they are called  ~newline~ that s all part of it  it s good on top of lemons and grapes   and off flew the Snow Queen  and Kay sat all on his own in the many mile long empty ice hall and looked at the pieces of ice and racked his brains till they creaked  he sat there stiff and still  he looked as if he had frozen to death  ~newline~ at last I ve found you   But he sat there quite still  stiff and cold    then little Gerda cried hot tears  they fell on his chest  they managed to enter his heart  they thawed out the lump of ice and consumed the tiny fragment of mirror inside  he looked at her and she sang the hymn     The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail  ~newline~ And where have I been   And he looked around him  ~newline~ Grandmother was sitting in God s bright sunshine and was reading out loud from the Bible   Unless you become as little children  you will not enter the kingdom of Heaven   And Kay and Gerda looked into each other s eyes  and suddenly they understood the old hymn  The roses are in blossom in the vale  There the Christ child too speaks without fail 
17,The Snow Queen,get,Their parents lived close to each other  they lived in two attics  where the roof from one next door house met that of the other and the gutter followed the eaves  a small window faced outwards from each house  you only needed to step over the gutter to get from the one window to the other  ~newline~   Outside the windows both their parents had a large wooden box where they grew the vegetables they needed as well as a small rose tree   there was one in each box and they grew there so beautifully  ~newline~ Since the boxes were very high  and the children knew that they were not allowed to clamber up onto them  they were often both allowed to climb out to each other and sit on their small stools under the roses  and there they played so marvellously together  ~newline~ In the summer they could get together by taking one big step  in the winter they first had to go down many stairs and up many stairs   outside the snow was swirling  ~newline~  My sledge  don t forget my sledge   he only remembered that now  and it was attached to one of the white hens  and it flew behind with the sledge on its back  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ I will give you my red shoes if you will return him to me   And the waves  she thought  nodded so strangely  then she took off her red shoes   her most precious possession   and flung both of them out into the river  but they fell close to the shore  and the small waves bore them back to her on the land  it was as if the river did not want to take the most precious thing she owned because it did not have little Kay  but she now thought that she hadn t thrown the shoes far enough out  and so she crept up into a boat that lay in the reeds  went right out to the farthest end and threw the shoes out  but the boat wasn t fixed to anything  and this movement of hers made it start to glide away from the land  she noticed this and hurried to get off  but before she could escape from the boat it was a couple of feet out and now slipping faster away  ~newline~ And Gerda was glad to get back onto dry land  though a bit afraid of the strange  old woman  ~newline~  Now you shall see how well the two of us are going to get on with each other   and while she combed little Gerda s hair  Gerda forgot more and more her playmate Kay  for the old woman was a sorceress  but not an evil one  she only did magic for her own pleasure  and now she wanted to keep little Gerda  ~newline~ The little black dog  as light as the bubbles  gets up on its hind legs and wants to join them on the swing  it flies  the dog tumbles down  barks and is angry  it s been duped  the bubbles burst   my song is a swinging board  a bursting picture of foam    What you tell me may well be beautiful  but you say things in such a mournful way and don t mention Kay at all  ~newline~ The other day she s sitting on the throne  and that is not all that much fun  people say  when she happens to start humming a tune that is precisely this one   Why shouldn t I get married    Hey  that s not a bad idea   she says  and was so eager to get married  but she wanted to have a husband that knew how to answer back when talked to  one that didn t just stand there looking fine   for that s so boring  ~newline~ So she had all her ladies in waiting drummed together  and when they heard what she wanted  they were so pleased   I like this   they said   I was thinking something similar only the other day     Believe you me  every word I m telling you is the truth   the crow said  ~newline~  I have a tame sweetheart who is free to walk around the palace  and she s told me everything   His sweetheart was a crow too  of course  for birds of a feather flock together  which in this case always means a crow  ~newline~  They grew both hungry and thirsty   but they didn t get so much as a glass of lukewarm water from the palace  ~newline~ I ll have a word with my tame sweetheart  she can surely advise us  for I must tell you that you  such a little girl as yourself  will never be allowed to get properly inside    Oh yes  I will   Gerda said  ~newline~   It s not possible for you to get inside the palace  for you are barefoot  the lifeguards in silver and footmen in gold wouldn t allow it  but don t cry  we ll get you up there even so  ~newline~ My sweetheart knows of some backstairs that lead up to the bedroom  and she knows where to get hold of the key   And they went into the garden  into the avenue where one leaf fell after the other  and when the palace lights were put out  one after the other  the crow led Gerda to a backdoor that was ajar  ~newline~ She took Gerda by the waist and said   They re not going to kill you  as long as I don t get angry with you  ~newline~ The robber girl looked at her very seriously  nodded slightly and said   They are not going to kill you  and if I nevertheless should happen to get angry with you  I d rather do it myself   and then she dried Gerda s eyes and stuffed both her hands in the lovely muff  which was so soft and so warm  ~newline~  You are so wise   the reindeer said   I know you can tie up all the winds in the world on a piece of sewing thread  if the skipper undoes the one knot  he gets a fair wind  if he undoes the other  it blows hard  and if he undoes the third and fourth  there is such a gale that the forests blow down  ~newline~ Can t you see how humans and animals have to serve her  how she has managed to get so far in the world on her own bare feet  ~newline~ If she is unable of her own accord to get to the Snow Queen and remove the glass from little Kay  we cannot help her to do so  ~newline~ But know we must first have a look at how Kay is getting on  ~newline~   But tell me how things have gone for you  and how you managed to get hold of him   And both Gerda and Kay told her 
17,The Snow Queen,first,Everyone who went to an ogre school   for he ran such a place   said far and wide that a miracle had taken place  now for the first time one could really see  they felt  what the world and people really looked like  ~newline~ In the summer they could get together by taking one big step  in the winter they first had to go down many stairs and up many stairs   outside the snow was swirling  ~newline~ What do the hyacinths say    There were three lovely sisters  so transparent and fine  the first one s dress was red  the second one s blue and the third one s completely white  hand in hand they danced by the still lake in the bright moonlight  ~newline~  Down into a small yard God s sun shone so warmly on the first day of spring  its rays slid down the neighbour s white wall  close by the first yellow flowers were growing   gleaming gold in the warm rays of the sun   old grandmother was outside in her chair  her granddaughter   the poor  lovely maid servant   came home on a short visit  she kissed her grandmother  ~newline~   Yes  yes   the crow said   believe you me  it is certain as I m sitting here  people flocked to the palace  there was such a hustle and bustle  but there was no success on either the first or the second day  ~newline~ They now entered the first hall  it was of rose pink satin with imitation flowers up the walls  here the dreams already shot past them  but at such a pace that Gerda did not catch a glimpse of the royal household  ~newline~ The forest crow  which had now got married  accompanied them the first twenty miles or so  it sat next to her  for it couldn t travel backwards  the other crow stood at the gate and flapped its wings  it didn t accompany them  for it had a headache  since it now had a permanent position and had eaten too much  ~newline~ goodbye   the prince and princess cried out  and little Gerda cried  and the crow cried    that is how the first many miles passed  then the crow also said goodbye  and that was the hardest farewell  it flew up into a tree and flapped its black wings as long as it could still see the carriage  which gleamed just like bright sunshine  ~newline~ There was no one at home here except an old Lapp woman  who was frying fish in the light of a train oil lamp  and the reindeer told her Gerda s entire story  but first its own  for it felt that it was much more important  and Gerda was so perishing with cold that she couldn t speak  ~newline~ But know we must first have a look at how Kay is getting on  ~newline~ Then they carried Kay and Gerda first to the Finnmark woman  where they warmed themselves in her hot living room and were given directions for their home journey  then on to the Lapp woman  who had sewn new clothes for them and got her sleigh ready  ~newline~ And the reindeer and the young reindeer ran alongside and followed them  right to the border of the country  where the first green signs of spring could be seen  where they said goodbye to the reindeer and the Lapp woman  ~newline~ And the first small birds started to chirp  the forest had light green buds  and out of it on a magnificent horse  which Gerda knew  it had been hitched to the gold carriage   came a young girl with a shining red cap on her head and holding pistols in front of her   it was the little robber girl  who was bored with being at home and wanted to head northwards first and then in a different direction if that didn t please her 
16,The Snow Queen,white, They are white bees that are swarming   the old grandmother said  ~newline~ One evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed  he crept up onto the chair by the window and looked out of the small hole  a few snowflakes were drifting down  and one of these  the largest of them  came to lie on the edge of one of the flower boxes  the snowflake grew and grew  and finally it turned into a whole woman  dressed in the finest  white gauze that was made up of millions of starlike flakes  ~newline~ Right in the middle of their game  a large sleigh came along  it was painted completely white and in it sat someone wrapped in a thick white fur with a thick furry cape  the sleigh went round the square twice  and Kay quickly fastened his small sledge to it  and now he got a ride too  ~newline~ The snowflakes grew larger and larger  finally they looked like large white hens  suddenly they leapt to one side  the large sleigh came to a halt  and the person driving it stood up  the great fur and cape were completely of snow  it was a lady  so tall and straight  so gleamingly white  it was the Snow Queen  ~newline~  My sledge  don t forget my sledge   he only remembered that now  and it was attached to one of the white hens  and it flew behind with the sledge on its back  ~newline~  Between the trees on a rope hangs the long board  it is a swing  two delightful young girls   their dresses are as white as snow  long green silk ribbons flutter from their hats   are swinging  their brother  who is taller than they are  is standing up on the swing  his arm round the rope to keep his balance  for in one hand he is holding a small bowl  in the other a clay pipe  he is blowing soapbubbles  the swing swings  and the soap bubbles fly out in lovely  changing colours  the last one is still hanging on the pipe stem and bending in the breeze   the swing swings  ~newline~ What do the hyacinths say    There were three lovely sisters  so transparent and fine  the first one s dress was red  the second one s blue and the third one s completely white  hand in hand they danced by the still lake in the bright moonlight  ~newline~  Down into a small yard God s sun shone so warmly on the first day of spring  its rays slid down the neighbour s white wall  close by the first yellow flowers were growing   gleaming gold in the warm rays of the sun   old grandmother was outside in her chair  her granddaughter   the poor  lovely maid servant   came home on a short visit  she kissed her grandmother  ~newline~ her white dress is hanging on its hook  it has also been washed in the tea pot and dried on the roof  she puts it on  the saffron yellow scarf round her neck  then her dress gleams even whiter  ~newline~ Here the ceiling was like a tall palm tree with leaves of glass  precious glass  and in the middle of the floor on a golden stalk hung two beds  each of which looked like a lily  The one was white  in it the princess lay  the other was red  and it was here that Gerda was going to look for little Kay  she turned aside one of the red leaves and then she saw a brown nape of a neck  ~newline~ And the princess looked out from the white lily bed and asked what was happening  ~newline~ A white hen bore his sledge  he sat in the Snow Queen s carriage  which streaked down low above the forest where we lay in our nest  she blew on us young birds  and all of them died except the two of us two  coo  ~newline~ She ran forward as fast as she could and was met by a whole regiment of snowflakes  but they did not fall from the sky  which was perfectly clear and gleaming with northern lights  the snowflakes followed the ground  and the closer they came  the larger they became  Gerda recalled how large and odd they had looked when she had looked at them through the burning glass  but here they were really large and frightening in a completely different way   they were alive  they were the Snow Queen s outposts  they had the strangest shapes  some looked like large  ugly hedgehogs  others like whole coils of snakes that stuck out their heads  and yet other like small fat bears with bristling hairs   all of them gleaming white  all of them were live snowflakes  ~newline~ There was never any form of gaiety here  not even a little bear ball where the gale could blow and the polar bears walk on their hind legs and put on airs and graces  never a small card party with slaps and blows to the mouth  never the slightest signs of a coffee party of the young white fox ladies   everything was empty  large and cold in the halls of the Snow Queen  ~newline~   I m going to whitewash them a bit 
16,The Snow Queen,would,The windows were often completely frozen shut  but they would heat small copper coins on the tiled stove  place a hot coin on the frozen windowpane and it would form so round  perfectly round a fine peephole  behind which a wonderfully mild eye would peer out  one from each window   that of the little boy and the little girl  ~newline~ What delightful summer days they were  how wonderful it was to be out there with the fresh rose trees that never seemed as if they would stop blooming  ~newline~ Soon his heart would be like a lump of ice  ~newline~ When she later came with the picture book  he said that it was only for babies  and if the grandmother told them stories  he always came up with some objection   and if he could  he would follow after her  put a pair of glasses on and speak exactly the way she did   so convincingly that it made people laugh at him  ~newline~  That s all the kisses you re getting   she said   for otherwise I would kiss you to death   Kay looked at her  she was so beautiful  he couldn t imagine a cleverer  lovelier face  now she didn t seem to be of ice  as she did when she sat outside his window and waved to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he didn t feel the slightest bit afraid  he told her that he could do mental arithmetic  and fractions  knew the area of countries and  how many inhabitants   and she smiled the whole time  then he felt that what he knew wasn t enough  and he looked up into the vast  vast realms of the air and she flew with him  flew high up onto the black cloud  and the storm roared and raged  it was as if it was singing old songs  ~newline~ The old woman was afraid that when Gerda saw the roses  she would think of her own and then remember little Kay and run away  ~newline~  The newspapers immediately came out edged with hearts and the princess s monogram  there people could read that any young man who was handsome was free to come up to the palace and speak with the princess  and the one who spoke in such a way that one could hear he belonged there  and who spoke best  the princess would take as her husband  ~newline~   It s not possible for you to get inside the palace  for you are barefoot  the lifeguards in silver and footmen in gold wouldn t allow it  but don t cry  we ll get you up there even so  ~newline~ He would of course be glad to see her  hear about the long way she had come for his sake  know how sorrowful everyone at home had been when he didn t return  ~newline~  Do you wish to fly freely   the princess asked   or would you like a permanent position as court crows  with everything left over in the kitchen   And both the crows bowed and asked for a permanent position  for they thought of the future and said   it s a good idea to have something for one s old age   as they put it  ~newline~ The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet  she was invited to stay at the palace and have a pleasant time  but all she asked for was to have a small carriage with a horse in front and a pair of small boots  and then she would be off again into the great wide world to find Kay  ~newline~  We also have to have him tied up  otherwise he too would run away from us  ~newline~ It was so hot inside that the Finnmark woman went around practically naked  she was tiny and her complexion muddy  she immediately loosened little Gerda s clothes  took off her mittens and boots  for otherwise she would have been too hot  placed a piece of ice on the reindeer s head and then read what had been written on the split cod  she read it three times and then she knew it by heart and she then put the fish in the cooking pot  for she never wasted anything  ~newline~ how empty and huge it is here   and he held on tight to Gerda  and she laughed and cried with joy  it was so wonderful that even the pieces of ice danced around with joy and when they were tired and lay down  they formed precisely the combination of letters the Snow Queen had said he was to try to find  so now he was his own master  and she would have to make him a present of the entire world and a pair of new skates  ~newline~ And snip snap clover song is over   the robber girl said  took them both by the hand and promised that if she ever happened to pass by their city  she would come up and pay them a visit  then she rode off into the great wide world  but Kay and Gerda walked hand in hand  and as they walked along  it was a wonderful spring with flowers and greenness everywhere  the church bells rang  and they knew the tall towers  the great city  that was where they lived  and they entered it and went to grandmother s door  up the stairs  into the living room  where everything stood just as before  and the clock said   tick  tock  and the hands turned round  but as they went through the door  they noticed that they had become adults
