herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become

flowers  and they grew in wild confusion over the paths  twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees  so that the whole place became dark and gloomy  ~newline~  Come  little

for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ Your fish s tail  which amongst us is considered so beautiful  is thought on earth to be quite ugly  they do not know any better  and they think it necessary to have two stout props  which they call legs  in order to be handsome   Then the little mermaid sighed  and looked sorrowfully at her fish s tail  ~newline~ The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently

while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass  to reach the dominions of the sea witch  and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm  bubbling mire  called by the witch her turfmoor  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ She saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms  as if they were iron bands  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~ She called the ugly water snakes her little chickens  and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom  ~newline~ But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw  ~newline~ If you will bear all this  I will help you    Yes  I will   said the little princess in a trembling voice  as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul  ~newline~ The first morning after he marries another your heart will break  and you will become foam on the crest of the waves    I will do it   said the little mermaid  and she became pale as death  ~newline~ My own blood must be mixed with it  that it may be as sharp as a twoedged sword    But if you take away my voice   said the little mermaid   what is left for me    Your beautiful form  your graceful walk  and your expressive eyes  surely with these you can enchain a man s heart  ~newline~ Put out your little tongue that I may cut it off as my payment  then you shall have the powerful draught    It shall be   said the little mermaid  ~newline~  If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood   said the witch   throw over them a few drops of the potion  and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces   But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this  for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught  which shone in her hand like a twinkling star  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught  and it seemed as if a two edged sword went through her delicate body  she fell into a swoon  and lay like one dead  ~newline~ He fixed his coal black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own  and then became aware that her fish s tail was gone  and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have  but she had no clothes  so she wrapped herself in her long  thick hair  ~newline~ This was great sorrow to the little mermaid  she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once  and she thought   Oh if he could only know that  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid raised her lovely white arms  stood on the tips of her toes  and glided over the floor  and danced as no one yet had been able to dance  ~newline~ Every one was enchanted  especially the prince  who called her his little foundling  and she danced again quite readily  to please him  though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives   The prince said she should remain with him always  and she received permission to sleep at his door  on a velvet cushion  ~newline~ They rode together through the sweet scented woods  where the green boughs touched their shoulders  and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~  Do you not love me the best of them all   the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say  when he took her in his arms  and kissed her fair forehead  ~newline~ She belongs to the holy temple  and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her  and we will never part    Ah  he knows not that it was I who saved his life   thought the little mermaid  ~newline~ The little mermaid smiled  and shook her head  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid  who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful  was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty

little mermaid kissed his hand  and felt as if her heart were already broken  ~newline~ The little mermaid  dressed in silk and gold  held up the bride s train  but her ears heard nothing of the festive music  and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony  she thought of the night of death which was coming to her  and of all she had lost in the world  ~newline~ The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea  when she had seen similar festivities and joys  and she joined in the dance  poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey  and all present cheered her with wonder  ~newline~ The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel  and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning  for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death  ~newline~ The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent  and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the prince s breast  ~newline~ She was in his thoughts  and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid  then she flung it far away from her into the waves  the water turned red where it fell  and the drops that spurted up looked like blood  ~newline~ The sun rose above the waves  and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid  who did not feel as if she were dying  ~newline~ The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs  and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam  ~newline~ You  poor little mermaid  have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing  you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit world by your good deeds  and now  by striving for three hundred years in the same way  you may obtain an immortal soul   The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun  and felt them  for the first time  filling with tears 
65,the little mermaid,sea,The Sea King s youngest daughter longs to be human and to be with the human prince she loves  so she trades her voice to the sea witch for legs  ~newline~ We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand  ~newline~ She was  however  deserving of very great praise  especially for her care of the little sea princesses  her grand daughters  ~newline~ They were six beautiful children  but the youngest was the prettiest of them all  her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose leaf  and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea  but  like all the others  she had no feet  and her body ended in a fish s tail  ~newline~ Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance  as if it were surrounded by the air from above  through which the blue sky shone  instead of the dark depths of the sea  ~newline~ It was the representation of a handsome boy  carved out of pure white stone  which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck  ~newline~ Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea  ~newline~ To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance  and not those below the sea  that the trees of the forest should be green  and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly  that it was quite a pleasure to hear them  ~newline~  When you have reached your fifteenth year   said the grandmother   you will have permission to rise up out of the sea  to sit on the rocks in the moonlight  while the great ships are sailing by  and then you will see both forests and towns   In the following year  one of the sisters would be fifteen  but as each was a year younger than the other  the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean  and see the earth as we do  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ and afterwards  when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water  she thought of the great city  with all its bustle and noise  and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells  down in the depths of the sea  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ She also swam towards the sun  but it sunk into the waves  and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea  ~newline~ The third sister s turn followed  she was the boldest of them all  and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea  ~newline~ This animal barked at her so terribly that she became frightened  and rushed back to the open sea  ~newline~ The fourth sister was more timid  she remained in the midst of the sea  but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land  ~newline~ She had seen the ships  but at such a great distance that they looked like sea gulls  ~newline~ The sea looked quite green  and large icebergs were floating about  each like a pearl  she said  but larger and loftier than the churches built by men  ~newline~ She had seated herself upon one of the largest  and let the wind play with her long hair  and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly  and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg  as if they were afraid of it  ~newline~ Towards evening  as the sun went down  dark clouds covered the sky  the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed  and the red light glowed on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea  ~newline~ On all the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling  while she sat calmly on the floating iceberg  watching the blue lightning  as it darted its forked flashes into the sea  ~newline~ They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have  and before the approach of a storm  and when they expected a ship would be lost  they swam before the vessel  and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea  and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom  ~newline~ The sea was calm  and the air mild and fresh  ~newline~ Great suns spurted fire about  splendid fireflies flew into the blue air  and everything was reflected in the clear  calm sea beneath  ~newline~ The colored lanterns had been extinguished  no more rockets rose in the air  and the cannon had ceased firing  but the sea became restless  and a moaning  grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves  still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window  rocking up and down on the water  which enabled her to look in  ~newline~ A dreadful storm was approaching  once more the sails were reefed  and the great ship pursued her flying course over the raging sea  ~newline~ At length the ship groaned and creaked  the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck  the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed  the ship lay over on her side  and the water rushed in  ~newline~ So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea  forgetting that they could crush her to pieces  ~newline~ Then she dived deeply under the dark waters  rising and falling with the waves  till at length she managed to reach the young prince  who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea  ~newline~ The sea here formed a little bay  in which the water was quite still  but very deep  so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach  which was covered with fine  white sand  and there she laid him in the warm sunshine  taking care to raise his head higher than his body  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become of the poor prince  ~newline~ It was built of bright yellow shining stone  with long flights of marble steps  one of which reached quite down to the sea  ~newline~ On many a night  too  when the fishermen  with their torches  were out at sea  she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince  that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half dead on the waves  ~newline~ They could fly over the sea in ships  and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds  and the lands they possessed  their woods and their fields  stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight  ~newline~ Then she applied to her old grandmother  who knew all about the upper world  which she very rightly called the lands above the sea  ~newline~ do they never die as we do here in the sea    Yes   replied the old lady   they must also die  and their term of life is even shorter than ours  ~newline~ We have not immortal souls  we shall never live again  but  like the green sea weed  when once it has been cut off  we can never flourish more  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ May hundreds of colossal shells  some of a deep red  others of a grass green  stood on each side in rows  with blue fire in them  which lighted up the whole saloon  and shone through the walls  so that the sea was also illuminated  ~newline~ The whole court applauded her with hands and tails  and for a moment her heart felt quite gay  for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on earth or in the sea  ~newline~ I will venture all for him  and to win an immortal soul  while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass  to reach the dominions of the sea witch  and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm  bubbling mire  called by the witch her turfmoor  ~newline~ All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon  and held fast  so that it never escaped from their clutches  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~ There sat the sea witch  allowing a toad to eat from her mouth  just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar  ~newline~  I know what you want   said the sea witch   it is very stupid of you  but you shall have your way  and it will bring you to sorrow  my pretty princess  ~newline~ You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths of the sea  and you believe that you will be able to charm the prince with it also  but this voice you must give to me  the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught  ~newline~ When the sun arose and shone over the sea  she recovered  and felt a sharp pain  but just before her stood the handsome young prince  ~newline~ While at the prince s palace  and when all the household were asleep  she would go and sit on the broad marble steps  for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold seawater  and then she thought of all those below in the deep  ~newline~ After that  they came to the same place every night  and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother  who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years  and the old Sea King  her father  with his crown on his head  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~  I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands  I sat beneath the foam  and watched till the human beings came to help him  ~newline~  You are not afraid of the sea  my dumb child   said he  as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king  ~newline~ And then he told her of storm and of calm  of strange fishes in the deep beneath them  and of what the divers had seen there  and she smiled at his descriptions  for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and smiled  and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was  but the cabin boy approached  and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw  ~newline~ His wedding morning would bring death to her  and she would change into the foam of the sea  ~newline~ The ship  with swelling sails and a favorable wind  glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea  ~newline~ The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea  when she had seen similar festivities and joys  and she joined in the dance  poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey  and all present cheered her with wonder  ~newline~ This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him  or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea  an eternal night  without a thought or a dream  awaited her  she had no soul and now she could never win one  ~newline~ Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince  when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again  and form into a fish s tail  and you will be once more a mermaid  and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam  ~newline~ She cast one more lingering  half fainting glance at the prince  and then threw herself from the ship into the sea  and thought her body was dissolving into foam  ~newline~ On the ship  in which she had left the prince  there were life and noise  she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her  sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam  as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves

the sun  and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset  ~newline~ When something like a black cloud passed between her and them  she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head  or a ship full of human beings  who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them  holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship  ~newline~ When the sisters rose  arm in arm  through the water in this way  their youngest sister would stand quite alone  looking after them  ready to cry  only that the mermaids have no tears  and therefore they suffer more  ~newline~  But they hurt me so   said the little mermaid  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows  and now and then  as the waves lifted her up  she could look in through clear glass window panes  and see a number of welldressed people within  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water  and when she again stretched out her head  it appeared as if all the

prince  ~newline~ The colored lanterns had been extinguished  no more rockets rose in the air  and the cannon had ceased firing  but the sea became restless  and a moaning  grumbling sound could be

prince came to life again  and smiled upon those who stood round him  ~newline~ Then the others heard the secret  and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was  ~newline~  If human beings are not drowned   asked the little mermaid   can they live forever  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have

they think it necessary to have two stout props  which they call legs  in order to be handsome   Then the little mermaid sighed  and looked sorrowfully at her fish s tail  ~newline~ Through the halls flowed a broad stream  and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing  ~newline~ The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all  ~newline~ I will venture all for him  and to win an immortal soul  while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass  to reach the dominions of the sea witch  and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm  bubbling mire  called by the witch her turfmoor  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little

heart will break  and you will become foam on the crest of the waves    I will do it   said the little mermaid  and she became pale as death  ~newline~ My own blood must be mixed with it  that it may be as sharp as a twoedged sword    But if you take away my voice   said the little mermaid   what is left for me    Your beautiful form  your graceful walk  and your expressive eyes  surely with these you can enchain a man s heart  ~newline~ Put out your little tongue that I may cut it off as my payment  then you shall have the powerful draught    It shall be   said the little mermaid  ~newline~ Then she cut off the mermaid s tongue  so that she became dumb  and would never again speak or sing  ~newline~  If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood   said the witch

caught sight of the glittering draught  which shone in her hand like a twinkling star  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught  and it seemed as if a two edged sword went through her delicate body  she fell into a swoon  and lay like one dead  ~newline~ This was great sorrow to the little mermaid  she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once  and she thought   Oh if

fondest hopes are all fulfilled  ~newline~ You will rejoice at my happiness  for your devotion to me is great and sincere   The little mermaid kissed his hand  and felt as if her heart were already broken  ~newline~ The little mermaid  dressed in silk and gold  held up the bride s train  but her ears heard nothing of the festive music  and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony  she thought of the night of death which was coming to her  and of all she had lost in the world  ~newline~ The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea  when she had seen similar festivities and joys  and she joined in the dance  poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey  and all present cheered her with wonder  ~newline~ The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel  and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning  for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death  ~newline~ Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince  when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again  and form into a fish s tail  and you will be once more a mermaid  and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam  ~newline~ The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent  and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the prince s breast  ~newline~ She was in his thoughts  and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid  then she flung it far away from her into the waves  the water turned red where it fell  and the drops that spurted up looked like blood  ~newline~ The sun rose above the waves  and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid  who did not feel as if she were dying  ~newline~ The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs  and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam  ~newline~  A mermaid has not an immortal soul  nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being  ~newline~ You  poor little mermaid  have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing  you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit world by your good deeds  and now  by striving for three hundred years in the same way  you may obtain an immortal soul   The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun  and felt them  for the first time  filling with tears 
51,the little mermaid,prince,The Sea King s youngest daughter longs to be human and to be with the human prince she loves  so she trades her voice to the sea witch for legs  ~newline~ She was  however  deserving of very great praise  especially for her care of the little sea princesses  her grand daughters  ~newline~ The large amber windows were open  and the fish swam in  just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows  excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses  ate out of their hands  and allowed themselves to be stroked  ~newline~ Each of the young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden  where she might dig and plant as she pleased  ~newline~ Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high rank  ~newline~ Among them was a young prince  the most beautiful of all  with large black eyes  he was sixteen years of age  and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing  ~newline~ The sailors were dancing on deck  but when the prince came out of the cabin  more than a hundred rockets rose in the air  making it as bright as day  ~newline~ And how handsome the young prince looked  as he pressed the hands of all present and smiled at them  while the music resounded through the clear night air  ~newline~ It was very late  yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship  or from the beautiful prince  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ Then she dived deeply under the dark waters  rising and falling with the waves  till at length she managed to reach the young prince  who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea  ~newline~ The sun rose up red and glowing from the water  and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince s cheeks  but his eyes remained closed  ~newline~ The sea here formed a little bay  in which the water was quite still  but very deep  so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach  which was covered with fine  white sand  and there she laid him in the warm sunshine  taking care to raise his head higher than his body  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become of the poor prince  ~newline~ She seemed frightened at first  but only for a moment  then she fetched a number of people  and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again  and smiled upon those who stood round him  ~newline~ Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince  ~newline~ She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered  the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away  but she never saw the prince  and therefore she returned home  always more sorrowful than before  ~newline~ It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden  and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince  but she gave up tending her flowers  and they grew in wild confusion over the paths  twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees  so that the whole place became dark and gloomy  ~newline~ Then the others heard the secret  and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was  ~newline~ She had also seen the festival on board ship  and she told them where the prince came from  and where his palace stood  ~newline~  Come  little sister   said the other princesses  then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water  close by the spot where they knew the prince s palace stood  ~newline~ Here she would sit and watch the young prince  who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight  ~newline~ On many a night  too  when the fishermen  with their torches  were out at sea  she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince  that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half dead on the waves  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently out of her father s palace  and while everything within was gladness and song  she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~  I know what you want   said the sea witch   it is very stupid of you  but you shall have your way  and it will bring you to sorrow  my pretty princess  ~newline~ You want to get rid of your fish s tail  and to have two supports instead of it  like human beings on earth  so that the young prince may fall in love with you  and that you may have an immortal soul   And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly  that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground  and lay there wriggling about  ~newline~ If you will bear all this  I will help you    Yes  I will   said the little princess in a trembling voice  as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul  ~newline~ You will never return through the water to your sisters  or to your father s palace again  and if you do not win the love of the prince  so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake  and to love you with his whole soul  and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife  then you will never have an immortal soul  ~newline~ You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths of the sea  and you believe that you will be able to charm the prince with it also  but this voice you must give to me  the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught  ~newline~ The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince s palace  and approached the beautiful marble steps  but the moon shone clear and bright  ~newline~ When the sun arose and shone over the sea  she recovered  and felt a sharp pain  but just before her stood the handsome young prince  ~newline~ The prince asked her who she was  and where she came from  and she looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes  but she could not speak  ~newline~ Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be  she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives  but she bore it willingly  and stepped as lightly by the prince s side as a soap bubble  so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful swaying movements  ~newline~ Beautiful female slaves  dressed in silk and gold  stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents  one sang better than all the others  and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her  ~newline~ Every one was enchanted  especially the prince  who called her his little foundling  and she danced again quite readily  to please him  though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives   The prince said she should remain with him always  and she received permission to sleep at his door  on a velvet cushion  ~newline~ She climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains  and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked  she only laughed  and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds travelling to distant lands  ~newline~ While at the prince s palace  and when all the household were asleep  she would go and sit on the broad marble steps  for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold seawater  and then she thought of all those below in the deep  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~  Yes  you are dear to me   said the prince   for you have the best heart  and you are the most devoted to me  you are like a young maiden whom I once saw  but whom I shall never meet again  ~newline~ I will take care of him  and love him  and give up my life for his sake   Very soon it was said that the prince must marry  and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife  for a fine ship was being fitted out  ~newline~ Although the prince gave out that he merely intended to pay a visit to the king  it was generally supposed that he really went to see his daughter  ~newline~ She knew the prince s thoughts better than any of the others  ~newline~  I must travel   he had said to her   I must see this beautiful princess  my parents desire it  but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride  ~newline~ The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit  ~newline~ But the princess had not yet appeared  ~newline~  It was you   said the prince   who saved my life when I lay dead on the beach   and he folded his blushing bride in his arms  ~newline~ She knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince  for whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home  she had given up her beautiful voice  and suffered unheard of pain daily for him  while he knew nothing of it  ~newline~ The prince kissed his beautiful bride  while she played with his raven hair  till they went arm in arm to rest in the splendid tent  ~newline~ Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince  when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again  and form into a fish s tail  and you will be once more a mermaid  and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam  ~newline~ Kill the prince and come back  hasten  do you not see the first red streaks in the sky  ~newline~ The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent  and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the prince s breast  ~newline~ She bent down and kissed his fair brow  then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter  then she glanced at the sharp knife  and again fixed her eyes on the prince  who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams  ~newline~ She cast one more lingering  half fainting glance at the prince  and then threw herself from the ship into the sea  and thought her body was dissolving into foam  ~newline~ On the ship  in which she had left the prince  there were life and noise  she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her  sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam  as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves  ~newline~ Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride  and fanned the prince  and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether 
46,the little mermaid,could,THE LITTLE MERMAID FAR out in the ocean  where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower  and as clear as crystal  it is very  very deep  so deep  indeed  that no cable could fathom it  many church steeples  piled one upon another  would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above  ~newline~ In calm weather the sun could be seen  looking like a purple flower  with the light streaming from the calyx  ~newline~ To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance  and not those below the sea  that the trees of the forest should be green  and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly  that it was quite a pleasure to hear them  ~newline~ However  each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit  and what she thought the most beautiful  for their grandmother could not tell them enough  there were so many things on which they wanted information  ~newline~ She could see the moon and stars shining faintly  but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ and afterwards  when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water  she thought of the great city  with all its bustle and noise  and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells  down in the depths of the sea  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest  the green hills  and the pretty little children who could swim in the water  although they had not fish s tails  ~newline~ She could see for so many miles around her  and the sky above looked like a bell of glass  ~newline~ She had seated herself upon one of the largest  and let the wind play with her long hair  and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly  and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg  as if they were afraid of it  ~newline~ When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface  they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw  but now  as grown up girls  they could go when they pleased  and they had become indifferent about it  ~newline~ They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have  and before the approach of a storm  and when they expected a ship would be lost  they swam before the vessel  and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea  and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom  ~newline~ But the sailors could not understand the song  they took it for the howling of the storm  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows  and now and then  as the waves lifted her up  she could look in through clear glass window panes  and see a number of welldressed people within  ~newline~ The ship itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people  and even the smallest rope  could be distinctly and plainly seen  ~newline~ It was very late  yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship  or from the beautiful prince  ~newline~ The colored lanterns had been extinguished  no more rockets rose in the air  and the cannon had ceased firing  but the sea became restless  and a moaning  grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves  still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window  rocking up and down on the water  which enabled her to look in  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea  forgetting that they could crush her to pieces  ~newline~ In the morning the storm had ceased  but of the ship not a single fragment could be seen  ~newline~ Near the coast were beautiful green forests  and close by stood a large building  whether a church or a convent she could not tell  ~newline~ At length she could bear it no longer  and told one of her sisters all about it  ~newline~ Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble rooms  with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry  while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to look at  ~newline~ And she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom  and how heartily she had kissed him  but he knew nothing of all this  and could not even dream of her  ~newline~ They could fly over the sea in ships  and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds  and the lands they possessed  their woods and their fields  stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently out of her father s palace  and while everything within was gladness and song  she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone  ~newline~ All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon  and held fast  so that it never escaped from their clutches  ~newline~ The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear  ~newline~ He fixed his coal black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own  and then became aware that her fish s tail was gone  and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have  but she had no clothes  so she wrapped herself in her long  thick hair  ~newline~ The prince asked her who she was  and where she came from  and she looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes  but she could not speak  ~newline~ She was very soon arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin  and was the most beautiful creature in the palace  but she was dumb  and could neither speak nor sing  ~newline~ This was great sorrow to the little mermaid  she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once  and she thought   Oh if he could only know that  ~newline~ She climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains  and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked  she only laughed  and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds travelling to distant lands  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~ I saw her but twice  and she is the only one in the world whom I could love  but you are like her  and you have almost driven her image out of my mind  ~newline~ I saw the pretty maiden that he loves better than he loves me   and the mermaid sighed deeply  but she could not shed tears  ~newline~ She thought she could distinguish her father s castle  and upon it her aged grandmother  with the silver crown on her head  looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the vessel  ~newline~ The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea  when she had seen similar festivities and joys  and she joined in the dance  poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey  and all present cheered her with wonder  ~newline~ This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him  or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea  an eternal night  without a thought or a dream  awaited her  she had no soul and now she could never win one  ~newline~ She saw the bright sun  and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings  she could see through them the white sails of the ship  and the red clouds in the sky  their speech was melodious  but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears  as they were also unseen by mortal eyes  ~newline~  Where am I   asked she  and her voice sounded ethereal  as the voice of those who were with her  no earthly music could imitate it 
44,the little mermaid,water,THE LITTLE MERMAID FAR out in the ocean  where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower  and as clear as crystal  it is very  very deep  so deep  indeed  that no cable could fathom it  many church steeples  piled one upon another  would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above  ~newline~ No  indeed  the most singular flowers and plants grow there  the leaves and stems of which are so pliant  that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life  ~newline~ The roof is formed of shells  that open and close as the water flows over them  ~newline~ Many nights she stood by the open window  looking up through the dark blue water  and watching the fish as they splashed about with their fins and tails  ~newline~ She could see the moon and stars shining faintly  but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes  ~newline~ and afterwards  when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water  she thought of the great city  with all its bustle and noise  and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells  down in the depths of the sea  ~newline~ In another year the second sister received permission to rise to the surface of the water  and to swim about where she pleased  ~newline~ On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines  palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest  she heard the birds singing  and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face  ~newline~ In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children  quite naked  and sporting about in the water  she wanted to play with them  but they fled in a great fright  and then a little black animal came to the water  it was a dog  but she did not know that  for she had never before seen one  ~newline~ But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest  the green hills  and the pretty little children who could swim in the water  although they had not fish s tails  ~newline~ The dolphins sported in the waves  and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every direction  ~newline~ They wished themselves back again in the water  and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below  and pleasanter to be at home  ~newline~ When the sisters rose  arm in arm  through the water in this way  their youngest sister would stand quite alone  looking after them  ready to cry  only that the mermaids have no tears  and therefore they suffer more  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~ A large ship  with three masts  lay becalmed on the water  with only one sail set  for not a breeze stiffed  and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water  and when she again stretched out her head  it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her  she had never seen such fireworks before  ~newline~ The colored lanterns had been extinguished  no more rockets rose in the air  and the cannon had ceased firing  but the sea became restless  and a moaning  grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves  still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window  rocking up and down on the water  which enabled her to look in  ~newline~ At length the ship groaned and creaked  the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck  the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed  the ship lay over on her side  and the water rushed in  ~newline~ The little mermaid now perceived that the crew were in danger  even she herself was obliged to be careful to avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the water  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ Then she dived deeply under the dark waters  rising and falling with the waves  till at length she managed to reach the young prince  who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea  ~newline~ She held his head above the water  and let the waves drift them where they would  ~newline~ The sun rose up red and glowing from the water  and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince s cheeks  but his eyes remained closed  ~newline~ The sea here formed a little bay  in which the water was quite still  but very deep  so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach  which was covered with fine  white sand  and there she laid him in the warm sunshine  taking care to raise his head higher than his body  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become of the poor prince  ~newline~ This made her very unhappy  and when he was led away into the great building  she dived down sorrowfully into the water  and returned to her father s castle  ~newline~ Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water  but she would tell them nothing  ~newline~  Come  little sister   said the other princesses  then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water  close by the spot where they knew the prince s palace stood  ~newline~ In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling  through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain  ~newline~ Now that she knew where he lived  she spent many an evening and many a night on the water near the palace  ~newline~ She would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do  indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony  which threw a broad shadow on the water  ~newline~ We sometimes live to three hundred years  but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water  and we have not even a grave down here of those we love  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ Then she heard the bugle sounding through the water  and thought   He is certainly sailing above  he on whom my wishes depend  and in whose hands I should like to place the happiness of my life  ~newline~ She had never been that way before  neither flowers nor grass grew there  nothing but bare  gray  sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool  where the water  like foaming millwheels  whirled round everything that it seized  and cast it into the fathomless deep  ~newline~ She laid her hands together across her bosom  and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water  between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi  which were stretched out on each side of her  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~ She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood  where large  fat water snakes were rolling in the mire  and showing their ugly  drab colored bodies  ~newline~ She called the ugly water snakes her little chickens  and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom  ~newline~ You will never return through the water to your sisters  or to your father s palace again  and if you do not win the love of the prince  so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake  and to love you with his whole soul  and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife  then you will never have an immortal soul  ~newline~ When at last the magic draught was ready  it looked like the clearest water  ~newline~ She stole into the garden  took a flower from the flower beds of each of her sisters  kissed her hand a thousand times towards the palace  and then rose up through the dark blue waters  ~newline~ While at the prince s palace  and when all the household were asleep  she would go and sit on the broad marble steps  for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold seawater  and then she thought of all those below in the deep  ~newline~ Once during the night her sisters came up arm in arm  singing sorrowfully  as they floated on the water  ~newline~ In the moonlight  when all on board were asleep  excepting the man at the helm  who was steering  she sat on the deck  gazing down through the clear water  ~newline~ She was in his thoughts  and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid  then she flung it far away from her into the waves  the water turned red where it fell  and the drops that spurted up looked like blood 
42,the little mermaid,like,They were six beautiful children  but the youngest was the prettiest of them all  her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose leaf  and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea  but  like all the others  she had no feet  and her body ended in a fish s tail  ~newline~ Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden  in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers  and blossoms like flames of fire  the fruit glittered like gold  and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually  ~newline~ In calm weather the sun could be seen  looking like a purple flower  with the light streaming from the calyx  ~newline~ One arranged her flower bed into the form of a whale  another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid  but that of the youngest was round like the sun  and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset  ~newline~ She was a strange child  quiet and thoughtful  and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels  she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers  like the sun  excepting a beautiful marble statue  ~newline~ The shadow had a violet tint  and waved to and fro like the branches  it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play  and trying to kiss each other  ~newline~ When something like a black cloud passed between her and them  she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head  or a ship full of human beings  who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them  holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ She could see for so many miles around her  and the sky above looked like a bell of glass  ~newline~ She had seen the ships  but at such a great distance that they looked like sea gulls  ~newline~ The sea looked quite green  and large icebergs were floating about  each like a pearl  she said  but larger and loftier than the churches built by men  ~newline~ They were of the most singular shapes  and glittered like diamonds  ~newline~  Well  now  you are grown up   said the old dowager  her grandmother   so you must let me adorn you like your other sisters   and she placed a wreath of white lilies in her hair  and every flower leaf was half a pearl  ~newline~ The waves rose mountains high  as if they would have overtopped the mast  but the ship dived like a swan between them  and then rose again on their lofty  foaming crests  ~newline~ At length the ship groaned and creaked  the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck  the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed  the ship lay over on her side  and the water rushed in  ~newline~ The mermaid kissed his high  smooth forehead  and stroked back his wet hair  he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden  and she kissed him again  and wished that he might live  ~newline~ It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden  and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince  but she gave up tending her flowers  and they grew in wild confusion over the paths  twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees  so that the whole place became dark and gloomy  ~newline~ Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof  and between the pillars that surrounded the whole building stood life like statues of marble  ~newline~ We have not immortal souls  we shall never live again  but  like the green sea weed  when once it has been cut off  we can never flourish more  ~newline~ Innumerable fishes  great and small  swam past the crystal walls  on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy  and on others they shone like silver and gold  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently out of her father s palace  and while everything within was gladness and song  she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone  ~newline~ Then she heard the bugle sounding through the water  and thought   He is certainly sailing above  he on whom my wishes depend  and in whose hands I should like to place the happiness of my life  ~newline~ She had never been that way before  neither flowers nor grass grew there  nothing but bare  gray  sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool  where the water  like foaming millwheels  whirled round everything that it seized  and cast it into the fathomless deep  ~newline~ Beyond this stood her house  in the centre of a strange forest  in which all the trees and flowers were polypi  half animals and half plants  they looked like serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground  ~newline~ The branches were long slimy arms  with fingers like flexible worms  moving limb after limb from the root to the top  ~newline~ You want to get rid of your fish s tail  and to have two supports instead of it  like human beings on earth  so that the young prince may fall in love with you  and that you may have an immortal soul   And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly  that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground  and lay there wriggling about  ~newline~  But think again   said the witch   for when once your shape has become like a human being  you can no more be a mermaid  ~newline~ Every moment the witch threw something else into the vessel  and when it began to boil  the sound was like the weeping of a crocodile  ~newline~ When at last the magic draught was ready  it looked like the clearest water  ~newline~  If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood   said the witch   throw over them a few drops of the potion  and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces   But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this  for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught  which shone in her hand like a twinkling star  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught  and it seemed as if a two edged sword went through her delicate body  she fell into a swoon  and lay like one dead  ~newline~ I have given away my voice forever  to be with him   The slaves next performed some pretty fairy like dances  to the sound of beautiful music  ~newline~ She climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains  and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked  she only laughed  and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds travelling to distant lands  ~newline~  Yes  you are dear to me   said the prince   for you have the best heart  and you are the most devoted to me  you are like a young maiden whom I once saw  but whom I shall never meet again  ~newline~ I saw her but twice  and she is the only one in the world whom I could love  but you are like her  and you have almost driven her image out of my mind  ~newline~ I cannot love her  she is not like the beautiful maiden in the temple  whom you resemble  ~newline~ She was in his thoughts  and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid  then she flung it far away from her into the waves  the water turned red where it fell  and the drops that spurted up looked like blood  ~newline~ The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs  and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam 
38,the little mermaid,said, When you have reached your fifteenth year   said the grandmother   you will have permission to rise up out of the sea  to sit on the rocks in the moonlight  while the great ships are sailing by  and then you will see both forests and towns   In the following year  one of the sisters would be fifteen  but as each was a year younger than the other  the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean  and see the earth as we do  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ She rose just as the sun was setting  and this  she said  was the most beautiful sight of all  ~newline~ But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest  the green hills  and the pretty little children who could swim in the water  although they had not fish s tails  ~newline~ The fourth sister was more timid  she remained in the midst of the sea  but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land  ~newline~ The sea looked quite green  and large icebergs were floating about  each like a pearl  she said  but larger and loftier than the churches built by men  ~newline~ They wished themselves back again in the water  and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below  and pleasanter to be at home  ~newline~  Oh  were I but fifteen years old   said she   I know that I shall love the world up there  and all the people who live in it   At last she reached her fifteenth year  ~newline~  Well  now  you are grown up   said the old dowager  her grandmother   so you must let me adorn you like your other sisters   and she placed a wreath of white lilies in her hair  and every flower leaf was half a pearl  ~newline~  But they hurt me so   said the little mermaid  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~  Come  little sister   said the other princesses  then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water  close by the spot where they knew the prince s palace stood  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul    No   said the old woman   unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother  and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you  and the priest placed his right hand in yours  and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter  then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind  ~newline~  Let us be happy   said the old lady   and dart and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live  which is really quite long enough  after that we can rest ourselves all the better  ~newline~  I know what you want   said the sea witch   it is very stupid of you  but you shall have your way  and it will bring you to sorrow  my pretty princess  ~newline~  You are but just in time   said the witch   for after sunrise to morrow I should not be able to help you till the end of another year  ~newline~ If you will bear all this  I will help you    Yes  I will   said the little princess in a trembling voice  as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul  ~newline~  But think again   said the witch   for when once your shape has become like a human being  you can no more be a mermaid  ~newline~ The first morning after he marries another your heart will break  and you will become foam on the crest of the waves    I will do it   said the little mermaid  and she became pale as death  ~newline~  But I must be paid also   said the witch   and it is not a trifle that I ask  ~newline~ My own blood must be mixed with it  that it may be as sharp as a twoedged sword    But if you take away my voice   said the little mermaid   what is left for me    Your beautiful form  your graceful walk  and your expressive eyes  surely with these you can enchain a man s heart  ~newline~ Put out your little tongue that I may cut it off as my payment  then you shall have the powerful draught    It shall be   said the little mermaid  ~newline~  Cleanliness is a good thing   said she  scouring the vessel with snakes  which she had tied together in a large knot  then she pricked herself in the breast  and let the black blood drop into it  ~newline~  There it is for you   said the witch  ~newline~  If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood   said the witch   throw over them a few drops of the potion  and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces   But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this  for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught  which shone in her hand like a twinkling star  ~newline~ Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be  she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives  but she bore it willingly  and stepped as lightly by the prince s side as a soap bubble  so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful swaying movements  ~newline~ Every one was enchanted  especially the prince  who called her his little foundling  and she danced again quite readily  to please him  though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives   The prince said she should remain with him always  and she received permission to sleep at his door  on a velvet cushion  ~newline~  Yes  you are dear to me   said the prince   for you have the best heart  and you are the most devoted to me  you are like a young maiden whom I once saw  but whom I shall never meet again  ~newline~ I will take care of him  and love him  and give up my life for his sake   Very soon it was said that the prince must marry  and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife  for a fine ship was being fitted out  ~newline~  I must travel   he had said to her   I must see this beautiful princess  my parents desire it  but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride  ~newline~  You are not afraid of the sea  my dumb child   said he  as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king  ~newline~ People said that she was being brought up and educated in a religious house  where she was learning every royal virtue  ~newline~  It was you   said the prince   who saved my life when I lay dead on the beach   and he folded his blushing bride in his arms  ~newline~  Oh  I am too happy   said he to the little mermaid   my fondest hopes are all fulfilled  ~newline~  We have given our hair to the witch   said they   to obtain help for you  that you may not die to night  ~newline~  After three hundred years  thus shall we float into the kingdom of heaven   said she 
38,the little mermaid,beautiful,Their appearance is very beautiful  for in each lies a glittering pearl  which would be fit for the diadem of a queen  ~newline~ They were six beautiful children  but the youngest was the prettiest of them all  her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose leaf  and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea  but  like all the others  she had no feet  and her body ended in a fish s tail  ~newline~ Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden  in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers  and blossoms like flames of fire  the fruit glittered like gold  and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually  ~newline~ She was a strange child  quiet and thoughtful  and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels  she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers  like the sun  excepting a beautiful marble statue  ~newline~ To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance  and not those below the sea  that the trees of the forest should be green  and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly  that it was quite a pleasure to hear them  ~newline~ However  each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit  and what she thought the most beautiful  for their grandmother could not tell them enough  there were so many things on which they wanted information  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices

rose just as the sun was setting  and this  she said  was the most beautiful sight of all  ~newline~ On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines  palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest  she heard the birds singing  and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face  ~newline~ But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest  the green hills  and the pretty little children who could swim in the water  although they had not fish s tails  ~newline~ The fourth sister was more timid  she remained in the midst of the sea  but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land  ~newline~ When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface  they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw  but now  as grown up girls  they could go when they pleased  and they had become indifferent about it  ~newline~ They wished themselves back again in the water  and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below  and pleasanter to be at home  ~newline~ They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have  and before the approach of a storm  and when they expected a ship would be lost  they swam before the vessel  and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea  and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom  ~newline~ And these things were never to be beautiful for them  for if the ship sank  the men were drowned  and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King  ~newline~ Among them was a young prince  the most beautiful of all  with large black eyes  he was sixteen years of age  and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing  ~newline~ It was very late  yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship  or from the beautiful prince  ~newline~ His limbs were failing him  his beautiful eyes were closed  and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his assistance  ~newline~ Near the coast were beautiful green forests  and close by stood a large building  whether a church or a convent she could not tell  ~newline~ It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden  and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince  but she gave up tending her flowers  and they grew in wild confusion over the paths  twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees  so that the whole place became dark and gloomy  ~newline~ Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble rooms  with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry  while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to look at  ~newline~ In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling  through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain  ~newline~ Your fish s tail  which amongst us is considered so beautiful  is thought on earth to be quite ugly  they do not know any better  and they think it necessary to have two stout props  which they call legs  in order to be handsome   Then the little mermaid sighed  and looked sorrowfully at her fish s tail  ~newline~ My own blood must be mixed with it  that it may be as sharp as a twoedged sword    But if you take away my voice   said the little mermaid   what is left for me    Your beautiful form  your graceful walk  and your expressive eyes  surely with these you can enchain a man s heart  ~newline~ The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince s palace  and approached the beautiful marble steps  but the moon shone clear and bright  ~newline~ She was very soon arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin  and was the most beautiful creature in the palace  but she was dumb  and could neither speak nor sing  ~newline~ I have given away my voice forever  to be with him   The slaves next performed some pretty fairy like dances  to the sound of beautiful music  ~newline~ I will take care of him  and love him  and give up my life for his sake   Very soon it was said that the prince must marry  and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife  for a fine ship was being fitted out  ~newline~  I must travel   he had said to her   I must see this beautiful princess  my parents desire it  but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride  ~newline~ I cannot love her  she is not like the beautiful maiden in the temple  whom you resemble  ~newline~ The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid  who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful  was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty  ~newline~ She knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince  for whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home  she had given up her beautiful voice  and suffered unheard of pain daily for him  while he knew nothing of it  ~newline~ The prince kissed his beautiful bride  while she played with his raven hair  till they went arm in arm to rest in the splendid tent  ~newline~ She saw her sisters rising out of the flood  they were as pale as herself  but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind  and had been cut off  ~newline~ She saw the bright sun  and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings  she could see through them the white sails of the ship  and the red clouds in the sky  their speech was melodious  but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears  as they were also unseen by mortal eyes  ~newline~ On the ship  in which she had left the prince  there were life and noise  she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her  sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam  as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves

quite dead  ~newline~ His limbs were failing him  his beautiful eyes were closed  and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his assistance  ~newline~ She held his head above the water  and let the waves drift them where they would  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become of the poor prince  ~newline~ Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water  but she would tell them nothing  ~newline~ She would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do  indeed once she went quite up the narrow

As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little

soul to you and retain his own as well  but this can never happen  ~newline~ Then she cut off the mermaid s tongue  so that she became dumb  and would never again speak or sing  ~newline~ She saw that in her father s palace the torches in the ballroom were extinguished  and all within asleep  but she did not venture to go in to them  for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever  she felt as if her heart would break  ~newline~ Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be  she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives  but she bore it willingly  and

were asleep  she would go and sit on the broad marble steps  for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold seawater  and then she thought of all those below in the deep  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~ I will take care of him  and love him  and give up my life for his sake

of human happiness and an immortal soul  ~newline~ His wedding morning would bring death to her  and she would change into the foam of the sea  ~newline~ This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him  or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea  an eternal night  without a thought or a dream  awaited her  she had no soul and now she could never win one  ~newline~ The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel  and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning  for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death

world s greatest story tellers  ~newline~ THE LITTLE MERMAID FAR out in the ocean  where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower  and as clear as crystal  it is very  very deep  so deep  indeed  that no cable could fathom it  many church steeples  piled one upon another  would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above  ~newline~ Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance  as if it were surrounded by the air from above  through which the blue sky shone  instead of the dark depths of the sea  ~newline~ It was the representation of a handsome boy  carved out of pure white stone  which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck  ~newline~  When you have reached your fifteenth year   said the grandmother   you will have permission to rise up out of the sea  to sit on the rocks in the moonlight  while the great ships are sailing by  and then you will see both forests and towns   In the following year  one of the sisters would be fifteen  but as each was a year younger than the other  the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean  and see the earth as we do  ~newline~ None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest  she who had the longest time to wait  and who was so quiet and thoughtful  ~newline~ In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children  quite naked  and sporting about in the water  she wanted to play with them  but they fled in a great fright  and then a little black animal came to the water  it was a dog  but she did not know that  for she had never before seen one  ~newline~ She had seated herself upon one of the largest  and let the wind play with her long hair  and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly  and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg  as if they were afraid of it  ~newline~ And these things were never to be beautiful for them  for if the ship sank  the men were drowned  and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King  ~newline~ When the sisters rose  arm in arm  through the water in this way  their youngest sister would stand quite alone  looking after

then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ At length she could bear it no longer  and told one of her sisters all about it  ~newline~ It was built of bright yellow shining stone  with long flights of marble steps  one of which reached quite down to the sea  ~newline~ In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling  through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain  ~newline~ Here she would sit and watch the young prince  who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ This evening we are going to have a court ball   It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on earth  ~newline~ May hundreds of colossal shells  some of a deep red  others of a grass green  stood on each side in rows  with blue fire in them  which lighted up the whole saloon  and shone through the walls  so that the sea was also illuminated  ~newline~ Innumerable fishes  great and small  swam past the crystal walls  on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy  and on others they shone like silver and gold  ~newline~ No one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently out of her father s palace  and while everything within was gladness and song  she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone  ~newline~ In the midst of this spot stood a house  built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings  ~newline~ The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear  ~newline~  If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood   said the witch   throw over them a few drops of the potion  and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces   But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this  for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught  which shone in her hand like a twinkling star  ~newline~ The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince s palace  and approached the beautiful marble steps  but the moon shone clear and bright  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught  and it seemed as if a two edged sword went through her delicate body  she fell into a swoon  and lay like one dead  ~newline~ When the sun arose and shone over the sea  she recovered  and felt a sharp pain  but just before her stood the handsome young prince  ~newline~ He fixed his coal black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own  and then became aware that her fish s tail was gone  and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have  but she had no clothes  so she wrapped herself in her long  thick hair  ~newline~ Beautiful female slaves  dressed in silk and gold  stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents  one sang better than all the others  and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid raised her lovely white arms  stood on the tips of her toes  and glided over the floor  and danced as no one yet had been able to dance  ~newline~ Every one was enchanted  especially the prince  who called her his little foundling  and she danced again quite readily  to please him  though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives   The prince said she should remain with him always  and she received permission to sleep at his door  on a velvet cushion  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and then they recognized her  and told her how she had grieved them  ~newline~ I saw her but twice  and she is the only one in the world whom I could love  but you are like her  and you have almost driven her image out of my mind  ~newline~ And then he told her of storm and of calm  of strange fishes in the deep beneath them  and of what the divers had seen there  and she smiled at his descriptions  for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and smiled  and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was  but the cabin boy approached  and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw  ~newline~ The church bells were ringing  and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets  and soldiers  with flying colors and glittering bayonets  lined the rocks through which they passed  ~newline~ Every day was a festival  balls and entertainments followed one another  ~newline~ Her skin was delicately fair  and beneath her long dark eye lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity  ~newline~ This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him  or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea  an eternal night  without a thought or a dream  awaited her  she had no soul and now she could never win one  ~newline~ Then all became still on board the ship  the helmsman  alone awake  stood at the helm  ~newline~ She cast one more lingering  half fainting glance at the prince  and then threw herself from the ship into the sea  and thought her body was dissolving into foam  ~newline~  Among the daughters of the air   answered one of them  ~newline~  A mermaid has not an immortal soul  nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being  ~newline~ But the daughters of the air  although they do not possess an immortal soul  can  by their good deeds  procure one for themselves  ~newline~  And we may even get there sooner   whispered one of her companions  ~newline~ The child does not know  when we fly through the room  that we smile with joy at his good conduct  for we can count one year less of our three hundred years 
27,the little mermaid,ship,She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns  the people and the animals  ~newline~  When you have reached your fifteenth year   said the grandmother   you will have permission to rise up out of the sea  to sit on the rocks in the moonlight  while the great ships are sailing by  and then you will see both forests and towns   In the following year  one of the sisters would be fifteen  but as each was a year younger than the other  the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean  and see the earth as we do  ~newline~ When something like a black cloud passed between her and them  she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head  or a ship full of human beings  who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them  holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship  ~newline~ She had seen the ships  but at such a great distance that they looked like sea gulls  ~newline~ She had seated herself upon one of the largest  and let the wind play with her long hair  and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly  and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg  as if they were afraid of it  ~newline~ On all the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling  while she sat calmly on the floating iceberg  watching the blue lightning  as it darted its forked flashes into the sea  ~newline~ They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have  and before the approach of a storm  and when they expected a ship would be lost  they swam before the vessel  and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea  and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom  ~newline~ And these things were never to be beautiful for them  for if the ship sank  the men were drowned  and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King  ~newline~ A large ship  with three masts  lay becalmed on the water  with only one sail set  for not a breeze stiffed  and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging  ~newline~ The ship itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people  and even the smallest rope  could be distinctly and plainly seen  ~newline~ It was very late  yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship  or from the beautiful prince  ~newline~ After a while  the sails were quickly unfurled  and the noble ship continued her passage  but soon the waves rose higher  heavy clouds darkened the sky  and lightning appeared in the distance  ~newline~ A dreadful storm was approaching  once more the sails were reefed  and the great ship pursued her flying course over the raging sea  ~newline~ The waves rose mountains high  as if they would have overtopped the mast  but the ship dived like a swan between them  and then rose again on their lofty  foaming crests  ~newline~ At length the ship groaned and creaked  the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck  the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed  the ship lay over on her side  and the water rushed in  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ In the morning the storm had ceased  but of the ship not a single fragment could be seen  ~newline~ She had also seen the festival on board ship  and she told them where the prince came from  and where his palace stood  ~newline~ They could fly over the sea in ships  and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds  and the lands they possessed  their woods and their fields  stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~ In the midst of this spot stood a house  built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings  ~newline~ I was in a ship that was wrecked  and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple  where several young maidens performed the service  ~newline~ I will take care of him  and love him  and give up my life for his sake   Very soon it was said that the prince must marry  and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife  for a fine ship was being fitted out  ~newline~  You are not afraid of the sea  my dumb child   said he  as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king  ~newline~ The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit  ~newline~ On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board ship  cannons were roaring  flags waving  and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected  ~newline~ The ship  with swelling sails and a favorable wind  glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea  ~newline~ All was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight  she laughed and danced with the rest  while the thoughts of death were in her heart  ~newline~ Then all became still on board the ship  the helmsman  alone awake  stood at the helm  ~newline~ She cast one more lingering  half fainting glance at the prince  and then threw herself from the ship into the sea  and thought her body was dissolving into foam  ~newline~ She saw the bright sun  and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings  she could see through them the white sails of the ship  and the red clouds in the sky  their speech was melodious  but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears  as they were also unseen by mortal eyes  ~newline~ On the ship  in which she had left the prince  there were life and noise  she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her  sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam  as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves 
26,the little mermaid,never,Her grandmother called the little birds fishes  or she would not have understood her  for she had never seen birds  ~newline~ When something like a black cloud passed between her and them  she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head  or a ship full of human beings  who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them  holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship  ~newline~ In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children  quite naked  and sporting about in the water  she wanted to play with them  but they fled in a great fright  and then a little black animal came to the water  it was a dog  but she did not know that  for she had never before seen one  ~newline~ But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest  the green hills  and the pretty little children who could swim in the water  although they had not fish s tails  ~newline~ And these things were never to be beautiful for them  for if the ship sank  the men were drowned  and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water  and when she again stretched out her head  it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her  she had never seen such fireworks before  ~newline~ She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered  the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away  but she never saw the prince  and therefore she returned home  always more sorrowful than before  ~newline~ do they never die as we do here in the sea    Yes   replied the old lady   they must also die  and their term of life is even shorter than ours  ~newline~ We have not immortal souls  we shall never live again  but  like the green sea weed  when once it has been cut off  we can never flourish more  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ He would give a soul to you and retain his own as well  but this can never happen  ~newline~ This evening we are going to have a court ball   It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on earth  ~newline~ She had never been that way before  neither flowers nor grass grew there  nothing but bare  gray  sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool  where the water  like foaming millwheels  whirled round everything that it seized  and cast it into the fathomless deep  ~newline~ All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon  and held fast  so that it never escaped from their clutches  ~newline~ You will never return through the water to your sisters  or to your father s palace again  and if you do not win the love of the prince  so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake  and to love you with his whole soul  and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife  then you will never have an immortal soul  ~newline~ Then she cut off the mermaid s tongue  so that she became dumb  and would never again speak or sing  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~  Yes  you are dear to me   said the prince   for you have the best heart  and you are the most devoted to me  you are like a young maiden whom I once saw  but whom I shall never meet again  ~newline~ She belongs to the holy temple  and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her  and we will never part    Ah  he knows not that it was I who saved his life   thought the little mermaid  ~newline~  He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple  therefore she will never return to the world  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid  who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful  was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty  ~newline~ She had never danced so elegantly before  ~newline~ This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him  or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea  an eternal night  without a thought or a dream  awaited her  she had no soul and now she could never win one 
25,the little mermaid,saw,However  each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit  and what she thought the most beautiful  for their grandmother could not tell them enough  there were so many things on which they wanted information  ~newline~ On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines  palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest  she heard the birds singing  and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face  ~newline~ The fifth sister s birthday occurred in the winter  so when her turn came  she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up  ~newline~ When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface  they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw  but now  as grown up girls  they could go when they pleased  and they had become indifferent about it  ~newline~ Presently they came in sight of land  she saw lofty blue mountains  on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them  ~newline~ She did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay  ~newline~ She seemed frightened at first  but only for a moment  then she fetched a number of people  and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again  and smiled upon those who stood round him  ~newline~ She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered  the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away  but she never saw the prince  and therefore she returned home  always more sorrowful than before  ~newline~ She saw him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat  with music playing and flags waving  ~newline~ She peeped out from among the green rushes  and if the wind caught her long silvery white veil  those who saw it believed it to be a swan  spreading out its wings  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ She saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms  as if they were iron bands  ~newline~ But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw  ~newline~ She saw that in her father s palace the torches in the ballroom were extinguished  and all within asleep  but she did not venture to go in to them  for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever  she felt as if her heart would break  ~newline~ Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be  she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives  but she bore it willingly  and stepped as lightly by the prince s side as a soap bubble  so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful swaying movements  ~newline~ After that  they came to the same place every night  and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother  who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years  and the old Sea King  her father  with his crown on his head  ~newline~  Yes  you are dear to me   said the prince   for you have the best heart  and you are the most devoted to me  you are like a young maiden whom I once saw  but whom I shall never meet again  ~newline~ I saw her but twice  and she is the only one in the world whom I could love  but you are like her  and you have almost driven her image out of my mind  ~newline~ I saw the pretty maiden that he loves better than he loves me   and the mermaid sighed deeply  but she could not shed tears  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and smiled  and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was  but the cabin boy approached  and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw  ~newline~ The little mermaid  dressed in silk and gold  held up the bride s train  but her ears heard nothing of the festive music  and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony  she thought of the night of death which was coming to her  and of all she had lost in the world  ~newline~ She saw her sisters rising out of the flood  they were as pale as herself  but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind  and had been cut off  ~newline~ She saw the bright sun  and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings  she could see through them the white sails of the ship  and the red clouds in the sky  their speech was melodious  but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears  as they were also unseen by mortal eyes  ~newline~ On the ship  in which she had left the prince  there were life and noise  she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her  sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam  as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves 
22,the little mermaid,see,In calm weather the sun could be seen  looking like a purple flower  with the light streaming from the calyx  ~newline~ The shadow had a violet tint  and waved to and fro like the branches  it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play  and trying to kiss each other  ~newline~ To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance  and not those below the sea  that the trees of the forest should be green  and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly  that it was quite a pleasure to hear them  ~newline~ Her grandmother called the little birds fishes  or she would not have understood her  for she had never seen birds  ~newline~  When you have reached your fifteenth year   said the grandmother   you will have permission to rise up out of the sea  to sit on the rocks in the moonlight  while the great ships are sailing by  and then you will see both forests and towns   In the following year  one of the sisters would be fifteen  but as each was a year younger than the other  the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean  and see the earth as we do  ~newline~ She could see the moon and stars shining faintly  but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes  ~newline~ In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children  quite naked  and sporting about in the water  she wanted to play with them  but they fled in a great fright  and then a little black animal came to the water  it was a dog  but she did not know that  for she had never before seen one  ~newline~ She could see for so many miles around her  and the sky above looked like a bell of glass  ~newline~ She had seen the ships  but at such a great distance that they looked like sea gulls  ~newline~ The dolphins sported in the waves  and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every direction  ~newline~ The fifth sister s birthday occurred in the winter  so when her turn came  she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows  and now and then  as the waves lifted her up  she could look in through clear glass window panes  and see a number of welldressed people within  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water  and when she again stretched out her head  it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her  she had never seen such fireworks before  ~newline~ The ship itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people  and even the smallest rope  could be distinctly and plainly seen  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted

to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ In the morning the storm had ceased  but of the ship not a single fragment could be seen  ~newline~ The mermaid kissed his high  smooth forehead  and stroked back his wet hair  he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden  and she kissed him again  and wished that he might live  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become of the poor prince  ~newline~ She seemed frightened at first  but only for a moment  then she fetched a number of people  and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again  and smiled upon those who stood round him  ~newline~ Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water  but she would tell them nothing  ~newline~ She had also seen the festival on board ship  and she told them where the prince came from  and where his palace stood  ~newline~ Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble rooms  with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry  while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to look at  ~newline~ She grew more and more fond of human beings  and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ This evening we are going to have a court ball   It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on earth  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~ But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught  and it seemed as if a two edged sword went through her delicate body  she fell into a swoon  and lay like one dead  ~newline~ Every one was enchanted  especially the prince  who called her his little foundling  and she danced again quite readily  to please him  though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives   The prince said she should remain with him always  and she received permission to sleep at his door  on a velvet cushion  ~newline~ She climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains  and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked  she only laughed  and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds travelling to distant lands  ~newline~  Do you not love me the best of them all   the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say  when he took her in his arms  and kissed her fair forehead  ~newline~ They will meet no more  while I am by his side  and see him every day  ~newline~ Although the prince gave out that he merely intended to pay a visit to the king  it was generally supposed that he really went to see his daughter  ~newline~  I must travel   he had said to her   I must see this beautiful princess  my parents desire it  but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride  ~newline~ And then he told her of storm and of calm  of strange fishes in the deep beneath them  and of what the divers had seen there  and she smiled at his descriptions  for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea  ~newline~ Then the little mermaid  who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful  was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty  ~newline~ The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea  when she had seen similar festivities and joys  and she joined in the dance  poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey  and all present cheered her with wonder  ~newline~ She knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince  for whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home  she had given up her beautiful voice  and suffered unheard of pain daily for him  while he knew nothing of it  ~newline~ She has given us a knife  here it is  see it is very sharp  ~newline~ Kill the prince and come back  hasten  do you not see the first red streaks in the sky  ~newline~ She saw the bright sun  and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings  she could see through them the white sails of the ship  and the red clouds in the sky  their speech was melodious  but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears  as they were also unseen by mortal eyes  ~newline~ Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride  and fanned the prince  and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether  ~newline~  Unseen we can enter the houses of men  where there are children  and for every day on which we find a good child  who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love  our time of probation is shortened  ~newline~ But when we see a naughty or a wicked child  we shed tears of sorrow  and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial   THE END
21,the little mermaid,human,The Sea King s youngest daughter longs to be human and to be with the human prince she loves  so she trades her voice to the sea witch for legs  ~newline~ When something like a black cloud passed between her and them  she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head  or a ship full of human beings  who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them  holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children  quite naked  and sporting about in the water  she wanted to play with them  but they fled in a great fright  and then a little black animal came to the water  it was a dog  but she did not know that  for she had never before seen one  ~newline~ They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have  and before the approach of a storm  and when they expected a ship would be lost  they swam before the vessel  and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea  and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ She grew more and more fond of human beings  and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own  ~newline~  If human beings are not drowned   asked the little mermaid   can they live forever  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~ In the midst of this spot stood a house  built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings  ~newline~ You want to get rid of your fish s tail  and to have two supports instead of it  like human beings on earth  so that the young prince may fall in love with you  and that you may have an immortal soul   And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly  that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground  and lay there wriggling about  ~newline~ But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw  ~newline~  But think again   said the witch   for when once your shape has become like a human being  you can no more be a mermaid  ~newline~  I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands  I sat beneath the foam  and watched till the human beings came to help him  ~newline~ If I were forced to choose a bride  I would rather choose you  my dumb foundling  with those expressive eyes   And then he kissed her rosy mouth  played with her long waving hair  and laid his head on her heart  while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul  ~newline~  A mermaid has not an immortal soul  nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being 
19,the little mermaid,soul,We have not immortal souls  we shall never live again  but  like the green sea weed  when once it has been cut off  we can never flourish more  ~newline~ Human beings  on the contrary  have a soul which lives forever  lives after the body has been turned to dust  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul    No   said the old woman   unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother  and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you  and the priest placed his right hand in yours  and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter  then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind  ~newline~ He would give a soul to you and retain his own as well  but this can never happen  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently out of her father s palace  and while everything within was gladness and song  she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone  ~newline~ I will venture all for him  and to win an immortal soul  while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ You want to get rid of your fish s tail  and to have two supports instead of it  like human beings on earth  so that the young prince may fall in love with you  and that you may have an immortal soul   And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly  that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground  and lay there wriggling about  ~newline~ If you will bear all this  I will help you    Yes  I will   said the little princess in a trembling voice  as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul  ~newline~ You will never return through the water to your sisters  or to your father s palace again  and if you do not win the love of the prince  so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake  and to love you with his whole soul  and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife  then you will never have an immortal soul  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~ If I were forced to choose a bride  I would rather choose you  my dumb foundling  with those expressive eyes   And then he kissed her rosy mouth  played with her long waving hair  and laid his head on her heart  while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul  ~newline~ This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him  or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea  an eternal night  without a thought or a dream  awaited her  she had no soul and now she could never win one  ~newline~  A mermaid has not an immortal soul  nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being  ~newline~ But the daughters of the air  although they do not possess an immortal soul  can  by their good deeds  procure one for themselves  ~newline~ After we have striven for three hundred years to all the good in our power  we receive an immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind  ~newline~ You  poor little mermaid  have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing  you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit world by your good deeds  and now  by striving for three hundred years in the same way  you may obtain an immortal soul   The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun  and felt them  for the first time  filling with tears 
19,the little mermaid,waves,She also swam towards the sun  but it sunk into the waves  and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea  ~newline~ The dolphins sported in the waves  and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every direction  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows  and now and then  as the waves lifted her up  she could look in through clear glass window panes  and see a number of welldressed people within  ~newline~ The colored lanterns had been extinguished  no more rockets rose in the air  and the cannon had ceased firing  but the sea became restless  and a moaning  grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves  still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window  rocking up and down on the water  which enabled her to look in  ~newline~ After a while  the sails were quickly unfurled  and the noble ship continued her passage  but soon the waves rose higher  heavy clouds darkened the sky  and lightning appeared in the distance  ~newline~ The waves rose mountains high  as if they would have overtopped the mast  but the ship dived like a swan between them  and then rose again on their lofty  foaming crests  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ Then she dived deeply under the dark waters  rising and falling with the waves  till at length she managed to reach the young prince  who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea  ~newline~ She held his head above the water  and let the waves drift them where they would  ~newline~ On many a night  too  when the fishermen  with their torches  were out at sea  she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince  that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half dead on the waves  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ The first morning after he marries another your heart will break  and you will become foam on the crest of the waves    I will do it   said the little mermaid  and she became pale as death  ~newline~ I was in a ship that was wrecked  and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple  where several young maidens performed the service  ~newline~ Then her sisters came up on the waves  and gazed at her mournfully  wringing their white hands  ~newline~ In a few minutes the sun will rise  and you must die   And then they sighed deeply and mournfully  and sank down beneath the waves  ~newline~ She was in his thoughts  and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid  then she flung it far away from her into the waves  the water turned red where it fell  and the drops that spurted up looked like blood  ~newline~ The sun rose above the waves  and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid  who did not feel as if she were dying  ~newline~ On the ship  in which she had left the prince  there were life and noise  she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her  sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam  as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves 
19,the little mermaid,came, When you have reached your fifteenth year   said the grandmother   you will have permission to rise up out of the sea  to sit on the rocks in the moonlight  while the great ships are sailing by  and then you will see both forests and towns   In the following year  one of the sisters would be fifteen  but as each was a year younger than the other  the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean  and see the earth as we do  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children  quite naked  and sporting about in the water  she wanted to play with them  but they fled in a great fright  and then a little black animal came to the water  it was a dog  but she did not know that  for she had never before seen one  ~newline~ This animal barked at her so terribly that she became frightened  and rushed back to the open sea  ~newline~ The fifth sister s birthday occurred in the winter  so when her turn came  she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up  ~newline~ There was music and song on board  and  as darkness came on  a hundred colored lanterns were lighted  as if the flags of all nations waved in the air  ~newline~ The sailors were dancing on deck  but when the prince came out of the cabin  more than a hundred rockets rose in the air  making it as bright as day  ~newline~ The colored lanterns had been extinguished  no more rockets rose in the air  and the cannon had ceased firing  but the sea became restless  and a moaning  grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves  still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window  rocking up and down on the water  which enabled her to look in  ~newline~ Presently they came in sight of land  she saw lofty blue mountains  on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them  ~newline~ Then bells sounded in the large white building  and a number of young girls came into the garden  ~newline~ She seemed frightened at first  but only for a moment  then she fetched a number of people  and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again  and smiled upon those who stood round him  ~newline~ It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden  and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince  but she gave up tending her flowers  and they grew in wild confusion over the paths  twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees  so that the whole place became dark and gloomy  ~newline~ Then the others heard the secret  and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was  ~newline~ She had also seen the festival on board ship  and she told them where the prince came from  and where his palace stood  ~newline~ She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood  where large  fat water snakes were rolling in the mire  and showing their ugly  drab colored bodies  ~newline~ The first morning after he marries another your heart will break  and you will become foam on the crest of the waves    I will do it   said the little mermaid  and she became pale as death  ~newline~ Then she cut off the mermaid s tongue  so that she became dumb  and would never again speak or sing  ~newline~ The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince s palace  and approached the beautiful marble steps  but the moon shone clear and bright  ~newline~ He fixed his coal black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own  and then became aware that her fish s tail was gone  and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have  but she had no clothes  so she wrapped herself in her long  thick hair  ~newline~ The prince asked her who she was  and where she came from  and she looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes  but she could not speak  ~newline~ At each moment her beauty became more revealed  and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves  ~newline~ Once during the night her sisters came up arm in arm  singing sorrowfully  as they floated on the water  ~newline~ After that  they came to the same place every night  and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother  who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years  and the old Sea King  her father  with his crown on his head  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~  I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands  I sat beneath the foam  and watched till the human beings came to help him  ~newline~ Then her sisters came up on the waves  and gazed at her mournfully  wringing their white hands  ~newline~ At last she came  ~newline~ Then all became still on board the ship  the helmsman  alone awake  stood at the helm 
19,the little mermaid,sun,In calm weather the sun could be seen  looking like a purple flower  with the light streaming from the calyx  ~newline~ One arranged her flower bed into the form of a whale  another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid  but that of the youngest was round like the sun  and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset  ~newline~ She was a strange child  quiet and thoughtful  and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels  she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers  like the sun  excepting a beautiful marble statue  ~newline~ She rose just as the sun was setting  and this  she said  was the most beautiful sight of all  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ She also swam towards the sun  but it sunk into the waves  and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea  ~newline~ On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines  palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest  she heard the birds singing  and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face  ~newline~ Towards evening  as the sun went down  dark clouds covered the sky  the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed  and the red light glowed on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~ Great suns spurted fire about  splendid fireflies flew into the blue air  and everything was reflected in the clear  calm sea beneath  ~newline~ At length the ship groaned and creaked  the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck  the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed  the ship lay over on her side  and the water rushed in  ~newline~ The sun rose up red and glowing from the water  and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince s cheeks  but his eyes remained closed  ~newline~ The sea here formed a little bay  in which the water was quite still  but very deep  so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach  which was covered with fine  white sand  and there she laid him in the warm sunshine  taking care to raise his head higher than his body  ~newline~ In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling  through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~  You are but just in time   said the witch   for after sunrise to morrow I should not be able to help you till the end of another year  ~newline~ I will prepare a draught for you  with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise  and sit down on the shore and drink it  ~newline~ The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince s palace  and approached the beautiful marble steps  but the moon shone clear and bright  ~newline~ When the sun arose and shone over the sea  she recovered  and felt a sharp pain  but just before her stood the handsome young prince  ~newline~ Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince  when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again  and form into a fish s tail  and you will be once more a mermaid  and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam  ~newline~ Haste  then  he or you must die before sunrise  ~newline~ In a few minutes the sun will rise  and you must die   And then they sighed deeply and mournfully  and sank down beneath the waves  ~newline~ The sun rose above the waves  and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid  who did not feel as if she were dying  ~newline~ She saw the bright sun  and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings  she could see through them the white sails of the ship  and the red clouds in the sky  their speech was melodious  but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears  as they were also unseen by mortal eyes  ~newline~ You  poor little mermaid  have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing  you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit world by your good deeds  and now  by striving for three hundred years in the same way  you may obtain an immortal soul   The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun  and felt them  for the first time  filling with tears 
18,the little mermaid,thought,One arranged her flower bed into the form of a whale  another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid  but that of the youngest was round like the sun  and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset  ~newline~ She was a strange child  quiet and thoughtful  and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels  she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers  like the sun  excepting a beautiful marble statue  ~newline~ However  each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit  and what she thought the most beautiful  for their grandmother could not tell them enough  there were so many things on which they wanted information  ~newline~ None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest  she who had the longest time to wait  and who was so quiet and thoughtful  ~newline~ and afterwards  when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water  she thought of the great city  with all its bustle and noise  and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells  down in the depths of the sea  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ She had always been silent and thoughtful  and now she was more so than ever  ~newline~ Here she would sit and watch the young prince  who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight  ~newline~ Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul    No   said the old woman   unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother  and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you  and the priest placed his right hand in yours  and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter  then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind  ~newline~ Your fish s tail  which amongst us is considered so beautiful  is thought on earth to be quite ugly  they do not know any better  and they think it necessary to have two stout props  which they call legs  in order to be handsome   Then the little mermaid sighed  and looked sorrowfully at her fish s tail  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently out of her father s palace  and while everything within was gladness and song  she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone  ~newline~ Then she heard the bugle sounding through the water  and thought   He is certainly sailing above  he on whom my wishes depend  and in whose hands I should like to place the happiness of my life  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ If you will bear all this  I will help you    Yes  I will   said the little princess in a trembling voice  as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul  ~newline~ This was great sorrow to the little mermaid  she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once  and she thought   Oh if he could only know that  ~newline~ While at the prince s palace  and when all the household were asleep  she would go and sit on the broad marble steps  for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold seawater  and then she thought of all those below in the deep  ~newline~ She belongs to the holy temple  and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her  and we will never part    Ah  he knows not that it was I who saved his life   thought the little mermaid  ~newline~ She knew the prince s thoughts better than any of the others  ~newline~ She thought she could distinguish her father s castle  and upon it her aged grandmother  with the silver crown on her head  looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the vessel  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and smiled  and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was  but the cabin boy approached  and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw  ~newline~ The little mermaid  dressed in silk and gold  held up the bride s train  but her ears heard nothing of the festive music  and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony  she thought of the night of death which was coming to her  and of all she had lost in the world  ~newline~ This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him  or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea  an eternal night  without a thought or a dream  awaited her  she had no soul and now she could never win one  ~newline~ All was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight  she laughed and danced with the rest  while the thoughts of death were in her heart  ~newline~ She was in his thoughts  and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid  then she flung it far away from her into the waves  the water turned red where it fell  and the drops that spurted up looked like blood  ~newline~ She cast one more lingering  half fainting glance at the prince  and then threw herself from the ship into the sea  and thought her body was dissolving into foam 
18,the little mermaid,rose,They were six beautiful children  but the youngest was the prettiest of them all  her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose leaf  and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea  but  like all the others  she had no feet  and her body ended in a fish s tail  ~newline~ She planted by the statue a rose colored weeping willow  ~newline~ She rose just as the sun was setting  and this  she said  was the most beautiful sight of all  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ When the sisters rose  arm in arm  through the water in this way  their youngest sister would stand quite alone  looking after them  ready to cry  only that the mermaids have no tears  and therefore they suffer more  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~ The sailors were dancing on deck  but when the prince came out of the cabin  more than a hundred rockets rose in the air  making it as bright as day  ~newline~ The colored lanterns had been extinguished  no more rockets rose in the air  and the cannon had ceased firing  but the sea became restless  and a moaning  grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves  still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window  rocking up and down on the water  which enabled her to look in  ~newline~ After a while  the sails were quickly unfurled  and the noble ship continued her passage  but soon the waves rose higher  heavy clouds darkened the sky  and lightning appeared in the distance  ~newline~ The waves rose mountains high  as if they would have overtopped the mast  but the ship dived like a swan between them  and then rose again on their lofty  foaming crests  ~newline~ The sun rose up red and glowing from the water  and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince s cheeks  but his eyes remained closed  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become of the poor prince  ~newline~  Come  little sister   said the other princesses  then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water  close by the spot where they knew the prince s palace stood  ~newline~ Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof  and between the pillars that surrounded the whole building stood life like statues of marble  ~newline~ The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear  ~newline~ She stole into the garden  took a flower from the flower beds of each of her sisters  kissed her hand a thousand times towards the palace  and then rose up through the dark blue waters  ~newline~ When the sun arose and shone over the sea  she recovered  and felt a sharp pain  but just before her stood the handsome young prince  ~newline~ The sun rose above the waves  and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid  who did not feel as if she were dying 
18,the little mermaid,long,The Sea King s youngest daughter longs to be human and to be with the human prince she loves  so she trades her voice to the sea witch for legs  ~newline~ Its walls are built of coral  and the long  gothic windows are of the clearest amber  ~newline~ All day long they played in the great halls of the castle  or among the living flowers that grew out of the walls  ~newline~ None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest  she who had the longest time to wait  and who was so quiet and thoughtful  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ She had seated herself upon one of the largest  and let the wind play with her long hair  and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly  and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg  as if they were afraid of it  ~newline~ She did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay  ~newline~ It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden  and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince  but she gave up tending her flowers  and they grew in wild confusion over the paths  twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees  so that the whole place became dark and gloomy  ~newline~ At length she could bear it no longer  and told one of her sisters all about it  ~newline~  Come  little sister   said the other princesses  then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water  close by the spot where they knew the prince s palace stood  ~newline~ It was built of bright yellow shining stone  with long flights of marble steps  one of which reached quite down to the sea  ~newline~ She peeped out from among the green rushes  and if the wind caught her long silvery white veil  those who saw it believed it to be a swan  spreading out its wings  ~newline~  Let us be happy   said the old lady   and dart and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live  which is really quite long enough  after that we can rest ourselves all the better  ~newline~ Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass  to reach the dominions of the sea witch  and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm  bubbling mire  called by the witch her turfmoor  ~newline~ The branches were long slimy arms  with fingers like flexible worms  moving limb after limb from the root to the top  ~newline~ The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw  that she stood still  and her heart beat with fear  and she was very nearly turning back  but she thought of the prince  and of the human soul for which she longed  and her courage returned  ~newline~ She fastened her long flowing hair round her head  so that the polypi might not seize hold of it  ~newline~ He fixed his coal black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own  and then became aware that her fish s tail was gone  and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have  but she had no clothes  so she wrapped herself in her long  thick hair  ~newline~ She belongs to the holy temple  and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her  and we will never part    Ah  he knows not that it was I who saved his life   thought the little mermaid  ~newline~  He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple  therefore she will never return to the world  ~newline~ If I were forced to choose a bride  I would rather choose you  my dumb foundling  with those expressive eyes   And then he kissed her rosy mouth  played with her long waving hair  and laid his head on her heart  while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul  ~newline~ The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit  ~newline~ Her skin was delicately fair  and beneath her long dark eye lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity  ~newline~ All was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight  she laughed and danced with the rest  while the thoughts of death were in her heart  ~newline~ She saw her sisters rising out of the flood  they were as pale as herself  but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind  and had been cut off 
17,the little mermaid,sisters,She was a strange child  quiet and thoughtful  and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels  she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers  like the sun  excepting a beautiful marble statue  ~newline~  When you have reached your fifteenth year   said the grandmother   you will have permission to rise up out of the sea  to sit on the rocks in the moonlight  while the great ships are sailing by  and then you will see both forests and towns   In the following year  one of the sisters would be fifteen  but as each was a year younger than the other  the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean  and see the earth as we do  ~newline~ When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface  they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw  but now  as grown up girls  they could go when they pleased  and they had become indifferent about it  ~newline~ Yet often  in the evening hours  the five sisters would twine their arms round each other  and rise to the surface  in a row  ~newline~ When the sisters rose  arm in arm  through the water in this way  their youngest sister would stand quite alone  looking after them  ready to cry  only that the mermaids have no tears  and therefore they suffer more  ~newline~  Well  now  you are grown up   said the old dowager  her grandmother   so you must let me adorn you like your other sisters   and she placed a wreath of white lilies in her hair  and every flower leaf was half a pearl  ~newline~ Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water  but she would tell them nothing  ~newline~ At length she could bear it no longer  and told one of her sisters all about it  ~newline~ There was so much that she wished to know  and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions  ~newline~ I will venture all for him  and to win an immortal soul  while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ You will never return through the water to your sisters  or to your father s palace again  and if you do not win the love of the prince  so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake  and to love you with his whole soul  and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife  then you will never have an immortal soul  ~newline~ She stole into the garden  took a flower from the flower beds of each of her sisters  kissed her hand a thousand times towards the palace  and then rose up through the dark blue waters  ~newline~ Once during the night her sisters came up arm in arm  singing sorrowfully  as they floated on the water  ~newline~ They stretched out their hands towards her  but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters did  ~newline~ Then her sisters came up on the waves  and gazed at her mournfully  wringing their white hands  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and smiled  and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was  but the cabin boy approached  and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw  ~newline~ She saw her sisters rising out of the flood  they were as pale as herself  but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind  and had been cut off

14,the little mermaid,upon,THE LITTLE MERMAID FAR out in the ocean  where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower  and as clear as crystal  it is very  very deep  so deep  indeed  that no cable could fathom it  many church steeples  piled one upon another  would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above  ~newline~ Fishes  both large and small  glide between the branches  as birds fly among the trees here upon land  ~newline~ She had seated herself upon one of the largest  and let the wind play with her long hair  and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly  and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg  as if they were afraid of it  ~newline~ Presently they came in sight of land  she saw lofty blue mountains  on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them  ~newline~ She seemed frightened at first  but only for a moment  then she fetched a number of people  and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again  and smiled upon those who stood round him  ~newline~ In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling  through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain  ~newline~ Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul    No   said the old woman   unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother  and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you  and the priest placed his right hand in yours  and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter  then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind  ~newline~ All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon  and held fast  so that it never escaped from their clutches  ~newline~ You will still have the same floating gracefulness of movement  and no dancer will ever tread so lightly  but at every step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp knives  and that the blood must flow  ~newline~ He fixed his coal black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own  and then became aware that her fish s tail was gone  and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have  but she had no clothes  so she wrapped herself in her long  thick hair  ~newline~ Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be  she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives  but she bore it willingly  and stepped as lightly by the prince s side as a soap bubble  so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful swaying movements  ~newline~ She thought she could distinguish her father s castle  and upon it her aged grandmother  with the silver crown on her head  looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the vessel  ~newline~ Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince  when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again  and form into a fish s tail  and you will be once more a mermaid  and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam

13,the little mermaid,foam,The waves rose mountains high  as if they would have overtopped the mast  but the ship dived like a swan between them  and then rose again on their lofty  foaming crests  ~newline~ The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water  then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen  and watched to see what would become of the poor prince  ~newline~ We sometimes live to three hundred years  but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water  and we have not even a grave down here of those we love  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ I will venture all for him  and to win an immortal soul  while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ She had never been that way before  neither flowers nor grass grew there  nothing but bare  gray  sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool  where the water  like foaming millwheels  whirled round everything that it seized  and cast it into the fathomless deep  ~newline~ The first morning after he marries another your heart will break  and you will become foam on the crest of the waves    I will do it   said the little mermaid  and she became pale as death  ~newline~ As the days passed  she loved the prince more fondly  and he loved her as he would love a little child  but it never came into his head to make her his wife  yet  unless he married her  she could not receive an immortal soul  and  on the morning after his marriage with another  she would dissolve into the foam of the sea  ~newline~  I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands  I sat beneath the foam  and watched till the human beings came to help him  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and smiled  and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was  but the cabin boy approached  and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw  ~newline~ His wedding morning would bring death to her  and she would change into the foam of the sea  ~newline~ Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince  when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again  and form into a fish s tail  and you will be once more a mermaid  and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam  ~newline~ She cast one more lingering  half fainting glance at the prince  and then threw herself from the ship into the sea  and thought her body was dissolving into foam  ~newline~ The sun rose above the waves  and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid  who did not feel as if she were dying  ~newline~ The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs  and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam  ~newline~ On the ship  in which she had left the prince  there were life and noise  she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her  sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam  as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves 
13,the little mermaid,palace,On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines  palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest  she heard the birds singing  and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face  ~newline~ And these things were never to be beautiful for them  for if the ship sank  the men were drowned  and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ She had also seen the festival on board ship  and she told them where the prince came from  and where his palace stood  ~newline~  Come  little sister   said the other princesses  then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water  close by the spot where they knew the prince s palace stood  ~newline~ Now that she knew where he lived  she spent many an evening and many a night on the water near the palace  ~newline~ But she soon thought again of the world above her  for she could not forget the charming prince  nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his  therefore she crept away silently out of her father s palace  and while everything within was gladness and song  she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone  ~newline~ I will venture all for him  and to win an immortal soul  while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ You will never return through the water to your sisters  or to your father s palace again  and if you do not win the love of the prince  so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake  and to love you with his whole soul  and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife  then you will never have an immortal soul  ~newline~ She saw that in her father s palace the torches in the ballroom were extinguished  and all within asleep  but she did not venture to go in to them  for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever  she felt as if her heart would break  ~newline~ She stole into the garden  took a flower from the flower beds of each of her sisters  kissed her hand a thousand times towards the palace  and then rose up through the dark blue waters  ~newline~ The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince s palace  and approached the beautiful marble steps  but the moon shone clear and bright  ~newline~ She was very soon arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin  and was the most beautiful creature in the palace  but she was dumb  and could neither speak nor sing  ~newline~ While at the prince s palace  and when all the household were asleep  she would go and sit on the broad marble steps  for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold seawater  and then she thought of all those below in the deep 
13,the little mermaid,looked,She could see the moon and stars shining faintly  but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ She could see for so many miles around her  and the sky above looked like a bell of glass  ~newline~ She had seen the ships  but at such a great distance that they looked like sea gulls  ~newline~ The sea looked quite green  and large icebergs were floating about  each like a pearl  she said  but larger and loftier than the churches built by men  ~newline~ And how handsome the young prince looked  as he pressed the hands of all present and smiled at them  while the music resounded through the clear night air  ~newline~ Your fish s tail  which amongst us is considered so beautiful  is thought on earth to be quite ugly  they do not know any better  and they think it necessary to have two stout props  which they call legs  in order to be handsome   Then the little mermaid sighed  and looked sorrowfully at her fish s tail  ~newline~ Beyond this stood her house  in the centre of a strange forest  in which all the trees and flowers were polypi  half animals and half plants  they looked like serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground  ~newline~ When at last the magic draught was ready  it looked like the clearest water  ~newline~ The prince asked her who she was  and where she came from  and she looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes  but she could not speak  ~newline~ The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel  and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning  for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death  ~newline~ She bent down and kissed his fair brow  then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter  then she glanced at the sharp knife  and again fixed her eyes on the prince  who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams  ~newline~ She was in his thoughts  and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid  then she flung it far away from her into the waves  the water turned red where it fell  and the drops that spurted up looked like blood 
13,the little mermaid,old,Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden  in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers  and blossoms like flames of fire  the fruit glittered like gold  and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually  ~newline~ She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns  the people and the animals  ~newline~ When something like a black cloud passed between her and them  she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head  or a ship full of human beings  who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them  holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ The third sister s turn followed  she was the boldest of them all  and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea  ~newline~  Oh  were I but fifteen years old   said she   I know that I shall love the world up there  and all the people who live in it   At last she reached her fifteenth year  ~newline~  Well  now  you are grown up   said the old dowager  her grandmother   so you must let me adorn you like your other sisters   and she placed a wreath of white lilies in her hair  and every flower leaf was half a pearl  ~newline~ Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high rank  ~newline~  Pride must suffer pain   replied the old lady  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~ At length she could bear it no longer  and told one of her sisters all about it  ~newline~ She had also seen the festival on board ship  and she told them where the prince came from  and where his palace stood  ~newline~ Then she applied to her old grandmother  who knew all about the upper world  which she very rightly called the lands above the sea  ~newline~ do they never die as we do here in the sea    Yes   replied the old lady   they must also die  and their term of life is even shorter than ours  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul    No   said the old woman   unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother  and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you  and the priest placed his right hand in yours  and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter  then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind  ~newline~  Let us be happy   said the old lady   and dart and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live  which is really quite long enough  after that we can rest ourselves all the better  ~newline~ Innumerable fishes  great and small  swam past the crystal walls  on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy  and on others they shone like silver and gold  ~newline~ She fastened her long flowing hair round her head  so that the polypi might not seize hold of it  ~newline~  If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood   said the witch   throw over them a few drops of the potion  and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces   But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this  for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught  which shone in her hand like a twinkling star  ~newline~ Beautiful female slaves  dressed in silk and gold  stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents  one sang better than all the others  and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her  ~newline~ While at the prince s palace  and when all the household were asleep  she would go and sit on the broad marble steps  for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold seawater  and then she thought of all those below in the deep  ~newline~ She beckoned to them  and then they recognized her  and told her how she had grieved them  ~newline~ After that  they came to the same place every night  and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother  who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years  and the old Sea King  her father  with his crown on his head  ~newline~ And then he told her of storm and of calm  of strange fishes in the deep beneath them  and of what the divers had seen there  and she smiled at his descriptions  for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea  ~newline~ The church bells were ringing  and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets  and soldiers  with flying colors and glittering bayonets  lined the rocks through which they passed  ~newline~  It was you   said the prince   who saved my life when I lay dead on the beach   and he folded his blushing bride in his arms  ~newline~ The little mermaid  dressed in silk and gold  held up the bride s train  but her ears heard nothing of the festive music  and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony  she thought of the night of death which was coming to her  and of all she had lost in the world  ~newline~ On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board ship  cannons were roaring  flags waving  and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected  ~newline~ Our old grandmother moans so for you  that her white hair is falling off from sorrow  as ours fell under the witch s scissors  ~newline~ The sun rose above the waves  and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid  who did not feel as if she were dying 
13,the little mermaid,much,Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea  ~newline~ None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest  she who had the longest time to wait  and who was so quiet and thoughtful  ~newline~ They wished themselves back again in the water  and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below  and pleasanter to be at home  ~newline~ The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better  but she could not help herself  so she said   Farewell   and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves  but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold  and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty  ~newline~ Among them was a young prince  the most beautiful of all  with large black eyes  he was sixteen years of age  and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing  ~newline~ She would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do  indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony  which threw a broad shadow on the water  ~newline~ She grew more and more fond of human beings  and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own  ~newline~ There was so much that she wished to know  and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul    No   said the old woman   unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother  and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you  and the priest placed his right hand in yours  and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter  then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind  ~newline~ I will venture all for him  and to win an immortal soul  while my sisters are dancing in my father s palace  I will go to the sea witch  of whom I have always been so much afraid  but she can give me counsel and help   And then the little mermaid went out from her garden  and took the road to the foaming whirlpools  behind which the sorceress lived  ~newline~ This was great sorrow to the little mermaid  she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once  and she thought   Oh if he could only know that

12,the little mermaid,beings,When something like a black cloud passed between her and them  she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head  or a ship full of human beings  who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them  holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object  but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene  she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince  when the ship parted  she had seen him sink into the deep waves  and she was glad  for she thought he would now be with her  and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water  so that when he got down to her father s palace he would be quite dead  ~newline~ She grew more and more fond of human beings  and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own  ~newline~  If human beings are not drowned   asked the little mermaid   can they live forever  ~newline~ Human beings  on the contrary  have a soul which lives forever  lives after the body has been turned to dust  ~newline~ As we rise out of the water  and behold all the land of the earth  so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see    Why have not we an immortal soul   asked the little mermaid mournfully   I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live  to be a human being only for one day  and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars    You must not think of that   said the old woman   we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings    So I shall die   said the little mermaid   and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves  or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun  ~newline~ The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea  and had sunk down into the deep waters  skeletons of land animals  oars  rudders  and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms  even a little mermaid  whom they had caught and strangled  and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess  ~newline~ In the midst of this spot stood a house  built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings  ~newline~ You want to get rid of your fish s tail  and to have two supports instead of it  like human beings on earth  so that the young prince may fall in love with you  and that you may have an immortal soul   And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly  that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground  and lay there wriggling about  ~newline~  I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands  I sat beneath the foam  and watched till the human beings came to help him  ~newline~ She saw the bright sun  and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings  she could see through them the white sails of the ship  and the red clouds in the sky  their speech was melodious  but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears  as they were also unseen by mortal eyes

12,the little mermaid,large,Fishes  both large and small  glide between the branches  as birds fly among the trees here upon land  ~newline~ The large amber windows were open  and the fish swam in  just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows  excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses  ate out of their hands  and allowed themselves to be stroked  ~newline~ She could see the moon and stars shining faintly  but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes  ~newline~ When she came back  she had hundreds of things to talk about  but the most beautiful  she said  was to lie in the moonlight  on a sandbank  in the quiet sea  near the coast  and to gaze on a large town nearby  where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars  to listen to the sounds of the music  the noise of carriages  and the voices of human beings  and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples  and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things  she longed for them more than ever  ~newline~ The whole sky looked like gold  while violet and rose colored clouds  which she could not describe  floated over her  and  still more rapidly than the clouds  flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun  looking like a long white veil across the sea  ~newline~ The sea looked quite green  and large icebergs were floating about  each like a pearl  she said  but larger and loftier than the churches built by men  ~newline~ She had seated herself upon one of the largest  and let the wind play with her long hair  and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly  and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg  as if they were afraid of it  ~newline~ A large ship  with three masts  lay becalmed on the water  with only one sail set  for not a breeze stiffed  and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging  ~newline~ Among them was a young prince  the most beautiful of all  with large black eyes  he was sixteen years of age  and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing  ~newline~ Near the coast were beautiful green forests  and close by stood a large building  whether a church or a convent she could not tell  ~newline~ Then bells sounded in the large white building  and a number of young girls came into the garden  ~newline~ In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling  through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain  ~newline~ She grew more and more fond of human beings  and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own  ~newline~ The walls and the ceiling of the large ball room were of thick  but transparent crystal  ~newline~ She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood  where large  fat water snakes were rolling in the mire  and showing their ugly  drab colored bodies  ~newline~  Cleanliness is a good thing   said she  scouring the vessel with snakes  which she had tied together in a large knot  then she pricked herself in the breast  and let the black blood drop into it
